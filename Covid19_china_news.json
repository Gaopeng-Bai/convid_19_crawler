In the case of a worrying situation, British Reuters reported that it was responsible for 16th local time. A senior official in response to the Brazilian epidemic said that the new crown epidemic crisis has been brought under control.\n On the 16th local time, the Brazilian Ministry of Health reported that 34,918 new cases of new crowns were confirmed in the country, reaching a record high in a single day, with a cumulative number of 923,189 confirmed cases; in the past 24 hours, 1,282 new deaths and a cumulative death case of 45241 cases. British Reuters reported on the 17th that affected by the new crown epidemic, Brazil has become the world's second largest hot spot in the new crown epidemic, and confirmed cases are rapidly approaching one million. And experts said that due to imperfect testing, the true number of new crown cases in Brazil may be higher.\n However, on the same day (16th), the senior official responsible for handling the epidemic, Braga Netto, director of the Civil Office of the Brazilian Presidential Palace, said in a webinar held in Rio de Janeiro that the crisis was under control.\n There was a crisis, and we sympathized with the families who lost loved ones, but the crisis has been brought under control. Braga Neto said that the number of deaths per million in Brazil is lower than in Belgium, Spain, the United Kingdom, Italy and France. He said he tried to convey an optimistic message in crisis management.\n However, WHO officials did not agree with his optimism.\n According to Reuters, Carissa Etienne, WHO Regional Director for the Americas, said at a video briefing in Washington that the Brazilian outbreak was a major problem. She said that the newly diagnosed cases in the largest country in Latin America accounted for about a quarter of the 4 million cases in the Americas, and deaths accounted for nearly 25%.\n Etienne said that in Brazil, we have not seen (virus) spread (speed) slowed down.\n The WHO Region of the Americas recommends that Brazil and other countries in the region should strengthen anti-epidemic measures to maintain social distance and urge them to reopen the economy slowly and carefully.\n According to reports, Brazilian President Bosonaro has long opposed the use of epidemic prevention measures to maintain social distance.

The mask is because you are worried that the mask will not be enough. However, with the changes in the actual situation and the emergence of relevant research, the government began to gradually change its recommendations.\n The picture shows Fodge, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\n According to reports, on the 12th, Fuchs said in an interview that they did not recommend people to wear masks at first, in order to ensure the supply of protective equipment for frontline medical staff, because many public health experts worry that N95 masks and medical masks Personal protective equipment will not be enough.\n The report said that the US mask reserve was almost exhausted in early April, and the Trump administration had to use the National Defense Production Law at the end of March to urgently produce medical protective equipment. Foch said that they hope to give priority to ensuring the protection needs of the first-line medical staff, so that they have sufficient masks.\n Foch also admitted that although masks cannot provide 100% protection, they are definitely better than not wearing them. Fuch says it can prevent you from infecting other people, because even if you feel good about yourself, you may be an asymptomatic person. In addition, it can also prevent you from being infected by other people by coughing, sneezing, spraying, etc.\n On June 15, 2020 local time, Redondo Beach, California, USA, a local fitness center was reopened, and students exercised in plastic fitness cabins to maintain social distance.\n At present, there are more than 2.13 million confirmed cases of the new crown in the United States and 116,000 deaths. During the period from January to March, although the New Crown epidemic was getting worse in the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention never recommended that Americans wear masks. It was not until early April that they recommended that ordinary people use simple cloth masks instead of personal protective equipment such as medical masks and N95 masks"

Integrating multiple US media, on the 16th local time, US President Trump predicted in a speech at a press conference that scientists will develop a new crown vaccine by the end of this year. He also praised the scientists who have developed AIDS vaccines. The above prediction is corroborated. However, the fact is that the AIDS vaccine does not yet exist...\n \"Capitol Hill\" reported that on the 16th local time, Trump held a press conference to sign the police reform executive order. At the meeting, Trump also talked about the progress of the new crown vaccine and praised scientists and doctors.\n These people are the best, smartest, and most outstanding. Trump said.\n They developed an AIDS vaccine. Trump went on to say that, as you know, (they also developed) a variety of things, and now a variety of companies are involved. But for the treatment of AIDS-(suffering from) AIDS was like (sentenced) to death, and now people live on drugs. This is an incredible thing.\n The Capitol Hill said that Trump seems to be referring to PrEP (pre-exposure prevention) medicine, a drug that prevents HIV/AIDS, and reduces the spread of AIDS in the form of regular medication.\n Subsequently, \"Capitol Hill\" said that Trump also mentioned the Ebola vaccine in his speech, and predicted that the new crown vaccine will be available by the end of this year.\n AIDS vaccine claims quickly attracted attention, and netizens began to correct Trump's false statements.\n Rep. Pramila Jayapal tweeted: Fact check: No AIDS vaccine. In fact, PrEP is a very effective drug for preventing HIV and can be very expensive-while the Trump administration’s project was supposed to pay thousands of uninsured people, but now they have to pay out of pocket Testing costs.\n Eugene GuE, chief executive of the virus testing company CoolQuit, said Trump's remarks about the AIDS vaccine are dangerous and may cause confusion.\n There is no such thing as an AIDS vaccine. We have drugs such as Truvada and Descovy. If used correctly, they are about 92% effective in preventing HIV infection. But Trump's remarks about HIV vaccines are both dangerously misinformation and false.\n For these AIDS prevention drugs to work properly, you must take them regularly under the guidance of a doctor. This is why Trump's AIDS vaccine is so dangerous. As a doctor, I am worried that some patients will have the wrong impression that HIV PrEP is a one-time vaccine.\n American political commentator Michael Knowles: I can’t help but notice that when Trump mentioned an AIDS vaccine, many people were laughing at him. After 37 years of research, the AIDS vaccine has not yet been developed. (But) insist on keeping us closed until we find a new crown vaccine, which should be achievable at any time"

    "content": "文|《财经》记者 陈亮 王静仪 蘧毛毛 李皙寅\n 编辑| 施智梁\n 一日三场发布会，北京市宣布将应急响应级别由三级调至二级。\n 二级应急响应级别下，离开北京变得困难。北京市规定，北京中高风险街乡、新发地市场相关人员严禁离京，其他人员坚持非必要不出京，确需离京的要持7日内核酸检测阴性证明。\n 原本计划在端午假期去广州探望朋友的陈小姐，在6月16晚毅然决定退票。\"去了也玩不好，估计会在各种地方被歧视，不如不去了\"，她告诉《财经》记者。\n 作为出行主力军的铁路，原计划在今年端午小长假增开多趟临时客车满足旅客出行需求。但在严峻的疫情防控态势下，下周的端午小长假涉及北京地区的铁路客流高峰料将泡汤。\n 另一大公共交通——航空也面临大面积取消的情况。6月16日，北京首都机场取消了超300架次的航班。首都机场取消率约40%，较6月15日翻了一倍。\n 飞友科技分析师郑洪峰告诉《财经》记者，目前航班大面积取消主要还是市场因素决定。非必要不出京，必须出京要持核酸证明打消了消费者的出行意愿，从而导致航空公司取消航班。未来几天涉及北京的航班情况可能会持续恶化。\n 出租车、顺风车等出京业务在6月15日已被叫停。长途客车也在逐渐减少发车班次。\n 航班大面积取消\n 10时左右走出长沙黄花机场，在京工作的黄女士长舒了一口气，\"很喜悦，离京成功了。\"她对《财经》记者感叹道。\n 黄女士在京期间没有待在北京中高风险地区，这让她顺利地登上了7时15分的飞机。落地长沙，扫了湖南健康码后顺利出关，并没有被要求检查核酸证明。\n 像黄女士这样幸运的人并不多，飞友科技数据显示，6月17日零时至6月17日10时，北京首都机场进港航班取消224班，出港航班取消180班。大兴机场进港航班取消99班，出港航班取消100班。北京进出港航班总体取消率近五成。\n 最为热门的京沪航线截至6月17日10时，已取消80班，总计划115班，取消率近70%。有少部分京沪航班已执行完成。\n 6月1日至6月12日，京沪航线平均执行架次约在90架左右。6月13日京沪线航班量出现下降，当日执行了66班。6月14日京沪航班执行量回升到88班，6月15日再度下滑至47班。\n 各大航空公司已展开针对北京的退改签特殊服务。《新京报》报道，南方航空称，由于北京疫情防控原因，相关航班可以申请免费退票，但最终以审核结果为准。旅客申请免手续费退票需要满足以下两个条件：一是购票日期在6月14日前；二是旅行日期在6月14日至6月30日之间的。\n 中国国航表示，购票日前在6月15日前，旅行日期在6月16日（含16日）——6月30日（含30日）之间，在航班起飞前提出退票的，可免收退票手续费，此外旅客还需满足四种情况之一。\n 旅客在提交申请时，北京健康宝小程序上显示的当日乘机人本人健康状态为\"集中观察\"或\"居家观察\"；旅客在提交申请时，国务院客户端小程序防疫行程卡上显示的当日乘机人本人行程卡为红卡、橙卡或黄卡；旅客在提交申请时，能够提供乘机人本人已被隔离进行医学观察，或居家观察，或者是在北京中、高风险地区居住的书面证明；按照目的地防疫政策要求，旅客由北京前往该地需要实施隔离观察等防疫措施。\n 郑洪峰建议，在疫情得到有效控制的情况下，如同及时管控一样，及时放松管控，这些对恢复出行市场信心、商务往来信心非常重要。\n 北京铁路端午高峰已泡汤\n 在京工作的孟先生6月16日下午接到了家人的电话，出于对疫情的忧虑，家人强烈建议他尽早离开北京回到河南洛阳老家。考虑到要收拾行李、预约快递寄行李、从通州的家赶到北京西站等时间因素，孟先生订购了第二天早上7点49分出发的高铁车票。\n 但是6月16日晚上，出京政策陡变，要求所有出京乘客必须持有核酸检验证明，非必要不出京。\"当时真的有点慌了，西站在丰台区，而且去西站的路上也要经过高风险地区\"，孟先生有些担心，到凌晨两点才能睡着。\n 6月17日早上五点，着急的家人们早早地打来电话催促，孟先生还是出发了。\n 乘坐地铁到达北京西站，一切顺利，进站、乘车等各种流程都和平时一样，只是车站里的人流肉眼可见地少了很多。\"一节车厢三个人，包车了。\"孟先生对《财经》记者感叹道。看到健康码一直保持绿色，他终于放下心来。\n 不止是位于丰台区的北京西站，一位早晨在东城区的北京站乘坐火车的旅客对《财经》记者说，候车厅人非常少，\"大概两三排才坐了一个人，人和人都隔得很远，哪像以前根本找不到位置坐。\"\n 截至上午11点，多位今天乘火车出京的旅客都告诉《财经》记者，上车时还不需要核酸检测结果，进站乘车的过程与以往类似，但车站和车厢内的乘客明显减少。\n 《财经》记者今晨致电北京铁路局宣传部，工作人员表示：\"目前对于乘车的要求是，进站要测温。\"这意味着昨晚的响应级别调整，传导到实际执行层面仍有一定的时间差。\n 北京西站工作人员也明确回应《财经》记者，核酸检测证明7日为北京市要求，北京西站目前未接到需要提供核酸检测报告才可乘车的通知，但到达目的地后，具体防控措施需咨询当地防疫机构。\n 一方面是政府表示非必要不出京，一方面是抵达后有被集中隔离的风险，不少旅客已经主动取消出行计划。\n 去年端午期间，北京铁路部门发送旅客近500万人次，日均约100万人次，今年原本也势头不减，计划增开多趟临客满足旅客出行需求。但在严峻的疫情防控态势下，下周的端午小长假铁路客流高峰在北京料将泡汤。\n 中国国家铁路集团有限公司今早发布公告，宣布自2020年6月17日0时起，旅客在车站、12306网站等各渠道，办理2020年6月16日24时前已购的进出北京地区各次列车有效车票退票时，均不收取退票手续费，购买铁路乘意险的一同办理。\n 汽车出行窗口在关闭\n 长途客车已逐步减少发车，部分车站已经关闭。\n 北京省际客运信息网显示：北京最大的长途客运汽车站，六里桥站自6月13日下午15时49分起至今，已有1102条停班通知，涵盖山西、陕西、河北、内蒙古等各地。已购票消费者，可以和车站沟通退票。\n 六里桥站工作人员告知《财经》记者，目前长途客车站仍有车辆发往市外，具体哪些线路调整，需要静候上级单位通知。更多具体情况不便接受媒体采访。\n 除六里桥站，莲花池长途汽车站、永定门长途汽车站均已发布公告，自6月17日起，采取暂停班线运营，恢复时间另行通知。\n 首都机场客运站原定唐山班线于6月16日开班，由于疫情影响，延缓开线时间，同时赤峰、廊坊、保定班线一并暂停营运，未恢复的班线暂停恢复运营，开通时间另行通知。\n 一位客运站工作人员建议记者可以考虑改为乘坐高铁。\n 出租车和顺风车方面，北京市交通委6月15日发布通知，要求北京市出租车（含巡游车、网约车）、顺风车暂停出京运营业务。\n 《财经》记者使用多家出行平台App，试图搭顺风车出城，均被提醒无法提供服务。部分出行平台在登录和用车界面，更新了健康生命和用户宣导界面，提醒用户行程中带好口罩，打喷嚏请用口罩遮住口鼻，尽快实现实名认证，以便后期追溯。\n 孙先生告诉《财经》记者，打车的时候，明显感觉到司机又变得谨慎起来，会提醒自己戴好口罩。\n 嘀嗒出行在\"顺风车健康声明\"中，新增了车主和乘车人，近期未到过新发地市场的承诺内容。滴滴则要求司机每天出车前，必须向平台上传北京健康宝的相关信息。\n 不止顺风车，单车的杀毒洗消工作也在加强。哈啰出行告诉《财经》记者，在医院等高风险地区早中晚三次回收，重点消毒把手、刹车、座椅、锁等用户接触部件。同时将丰台区新发地农贸市场及周边设立禁停区，未来将在中高风险区域动态设置禁停区。\n 市内交通量明显下降\n 6月17日早上9点至10点半，原本拥堵不堪的二环、三环等多个路段变得畅通无阻。在地图软件上则更为直观，以往早高峰一片紫红色的路段，今日已是\"绿意盎然\"。\n 以东三环的国贸桥，以及南三环的玉泉营桥附近为例，平日里这些路段最为拥堵，也最让司机头疼的路段，今天即使在早高峰时间，车辆仍可正常通行。\n 李先生是一位神州优车司机，他告诉《财经》记者，今晨七时许，他用了不到半小时的时间便从马家堡东路开到了国贸三期，\"这在以前不敢想象的。以前早高峰在三环路上开车，车子堵得爬都爬不动，一个多小时都不一定能到。\"\n 二环路上，车流也稀疏了很多。记者途径朝阳SOHO，保利大厦等附近路段，车流量不到平时的一半。\n 此次突如其来的疫情不像农历年后疫情刚暴发时那般让人不敢出门。《财经》记者发现不少北京市民仍正常出行，但是行人之间大多行色匆匆，排队都主动间隔一定距离，彼此之间多了一些防备。\n 受疫情影响，乘坐公共交通出行的市民人数也锐减。大多数公交车上的乘客只有寥寥数人，地铁站的人流量也比以往少了很多。\n 乘坐公共交通的人减少与出行的人减少有关。从6月16日起，北京开始恢复社区封闭式管理，同时下调办公楼宇到岗率，鼓励远程、居家等弹性办公，鼓励错峰上下班。而图书馆、博物馆、美术馆等室内公共场所及公园景区限流30%，实行分时段预约限流、远端疏导等防控措。\n 北京市民杨女士今天由于限号的缘故，只能打车前往单位，但她有些担心安全问题。\"希望北京能够放开限号，现在出门打车或者乘坐公共交通，我都有些担心。\"杨女士对《财经》记者说。\n 不过，在高峰时段打车已经没有平时方便。陈先生是一位滴滴出行平台的司机，他向《财经》记者介绍，今天在金融街附近拉活员工到岗率应该不到平时的70%。但是乘客打滴滴或者出租车时，相关平台都显示了乘客排队情况以及调配车辆情况。\n \"滴滴平台平时是派单给司机，今天乘客打车的需求量大，司机自己抢单就可以了，一般我们都选大单拉。\"陈先生介绍称，\"并且很多北京的出租车司机都住在远郊，现在很多地方也不让出来拉活了，再加上需求量大，因此乘客打车得排队。\"\n 此外，北京小区已经严格管理出入人群情况，有的小区必须出示出入证才可通行，快递和外卖人员已经不让进小区。一些商铺已经关门停业，此前备受欢迎的老北京炸酱面门店现在暂停营业。\n （除标注外，其他所有图片均为记者拍摄"

    "content": "The salmon before entering the contaminated site did not detect the new coronavirus. This conclusion freed the salmon who was once in a storm, and the salmon was back on the shelves or just around the corner.\n The salmon was acquitted\n On the evening of June 16, Shi Guoqing, deputy director of the Emergency Center of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention and a member of the National New Coronary Pneumonia Expert Group, said at the 120th Beijing New Coronary Pneumonia Outbreak Prevention and Control Work in Beijing that there is no evidence to suggest that salmon The host or intermediate host of the new coronavirus.\n Shi Guoqing also said that in the contaminated local sites related to the epidemic in this new place, the salmon were indeed found to be contaminated by testing, but the salmon before entering the contaminated site did not detect the new coronavirus.\n The connection between salmon and the new crown virus was first exposed by Zhang Yuxi, chairman of the Beijing Xinfadi wholesale market, in an interview with the Beijing News reporter on the evening of June 12. Zhang Yuxi said that during the random inspection of relevant departments, the new coronavirus was detected from the cutting board of imported salmon, and the source of the product was from the Beijing-Shenzhen seafood market.\n For a time, aquatic products in major supermarkets in Beijing were taken off the shelf for storage. At 6 pm on June 12, the Beijing-Shenzhen Seafood Market was closed, and vendors and staff in the market were prohibited from entering and exiting, and outsiders were not allowed to enter.\n The test conclusion disclosed by Shi Guoqing allowed the salmon to be acquitted.\n According to the official information, the Beijing Center for Disease Control and Prevention conducted sampling and testing of the seafood area of ​​the Beijing-Shenzhen Seafood Market, especially the salmon trading stalls and public areas. A total of 469 samples were collected, including 186 swallowing swabs and 283 environmental samples. , The results are currently negative. 155 environmental samples were collected from the Yuegezhuang market, and the results were all negative. 40 environmental samples in the new place were positive, and 45 of the 517 samples collected in the new place were positive.\n At present, no infected persons have been found in restaurants that operate salmon, and no dinosaur infections have been found. The epidemiological survey only points to new places rather than salmon. Moreover, Beijing is not the only destination for imported salmon. There is no salmon outbreak in major cities and ports. Zhong Kai said.\n However, an epidemiological expert suggested that the official did not disclose in detail when the tested salmon was imported. The incubation period of the new coronavirus is currently at least 3 days, some up to 2 weeks. Judging from the published cases, the earliest onset time was June 4th, which means that the infection of the virus was 3-14 days before the 4th. Whether previous aquatic products such as salmon have been contaminated is currently not ruled out.\n It is not clear who the new coronavirus was contaminated and when it was contaminated by the cutting board of imported salmon that was newly cut. It is still unclear and further traceability investigation is still required, but it is extremely difficult.\n I think it's time to reconsider when and how to list. Dr. Kai Kai, the director of the Kexin Food and Nutrition Information Exchange Center, said that in the case of insufficient information, it is correct to temporarily remove salmon from the risk aversion. With the information becoming clearer, it is also correct to restock the salmon. However, how to put it on the shelf is a difficult problem and a responsibility.\n Will consumers pay if they re-list?\n The delisting is fast, and the recovery of supply chain and consumer confidence is always slow. If the government and the professional community release positive signals, recovery will be faster. Zhong Kai said that businesses can also proactively provide virus detection reports to appease consumers.\n Shi Guoqing also said that when using salmon or other foods, they must be cleaned and processed as necessary"

There must be no failure. The epidemic prevention and control cannot be too strict, and how much effort should be given.\n As of June 13, Beijing has quickly investigated the market personnel in emerging areas such as outbreaks, residents of surrounding communities, those involved in big data to investigate the market in which the epidemic is involved, active reports of community knocking operations, personnel related to contact history, and farmers’ markets in the city. About 356,000 staff members conducted nucleic acid testing.\n Beijing has relevant personnel from the Xinfadi and other epidemic-infected markets, communities involved in the epidemic, permanent residents of Beijing's middle- and high-risk streets, townships and townships, employees of Beijing's medical and health institutions, and public service personnel, students and faculty members who have returned to school, and focus on participation Six types of personnel, including frontline workers in the regional community prevention and control, should be inspected thoroughly.\n Citizens are advised not to go to the hospital to go to the hot clinic for nucleic acid detection, to reduce personnel gathering and avoid cross-infection. At present, the city's average daily sampling is about 400,000 people, and the detection capacity will be expanded later.\n From 0:00 to 24:00 on June 16, 31 new cases of new coronary pneumonia were diagnosed in this city, including 19 males and 12 females; the average age was 43 years old, minimum 8 years old, and maximum 70 years old; 19 cases in Fengtai District and Daxing District There were 5 cases, 3 cases in Dongcheng District, 3 cases in Haidian District, and 1 case in Xicheng District; 10 cases were clinically classified as light, 20 cases were common, and 1 case was heavy. All cases were related to the new market.\n Beijing has reported a total of 137 confirmed cases of new coronary pneumonia in the past 6 days. According to the clinical classification, there are 1 critically ill patients and 4 severely ill patients. The remaining patients are mostly light and common.\n Currently, the epidemic situation in Beijing is still on the rise. Considering that this market is the largest agricultural and sideline product trading place in our city, it has extensive logistics, intensive personnel, high risk of epidemic spread, and great difficulty in control. It is not excluded that the number of patients will continue for a certain period in the future.\n Beijing catering companies have suspended holding mass gatherings such as wedding banquets and banquets. All kinds of offline ceremonies, press conferences, on-site exhibitions and other promotional activities that are likely to cause people to gather will be closed.\n The market supply of vegetables and other necessities is stable. The Beijing Municipal Bureau of Commerce comprehensively monitors all channels, and the supply of major supermarket chains and community vegetable markets in Beijing is relatively stable and in good order. The shortage of goods in the market is decreasing. From June 14th to 16th, a total of 64 stores of 37 companies were out of stock, of which 31 were out of stock on June 14, 27 were on the 15th, and 6 were on the 16th. Currently, the number of out-of-stock stores continues to decline"

    "content": "文/腾讯汽车 张翠翠\n 全球范围内的疫情还在持续，在还没有明显的拐点出现前，全球经济的不确定性仍然是笼罩在汽车产业上空的一层阴霾。\n 根据欧洲汽车制造商协会(ACEA)最新发布的数据，今年3月欧洲乘用车市场新车注册量同比跌幅达51.8%。而根据IHS Markit本周二发布的最新研究报告，预计今年美国轻型车(包括轿车及货卡车)销量将下降26.6%至1250万辆，跌至2010年以来新低。\n 事实上，从3月初开始陆续停工停产的汽车工厂在全球范围内就超过了160家，而近两个月的产业停摆、新车销售断崖式下滑已经给各家车企带来了巨大的资金压力。一些车企不得不通过减薪和裁员的手段来帮助企业减负。\n 正因如此，虽然很多地区目前疫情情况还不明朗，但越来越多的车企还是选择积极准备复工，并采取了很多极端手段来保障工厂重启，以期尽快恢复正常。\n 与此同时，中国地区先一步的复工复产，也使其成为各大跨国车企销量数据单上唯一的亮色。不过恢复生产只是第一步，更大的挑战在于恢复消费需求，而全球车市的真正重启还有很长一段路要走。\n 根据腾讯汽车统计，截至4月26日，有超过20家车企和品牌已经有部分工厂复工或正计划复工。此项统计与3月初的停工情况对比来看，有超过半数的工厂都将在4月底或5月初迎来复工。\n 同时，从目前的准备形势来看，欧洲地区的复工情况要早于北美地区。而在疫情得以控制的欧洲地区，大众、戴姆勒、FCA、宝马、雷诺、现代和沃尔沃等品牌已经制定了明确的复工计划。\n 4月21日意大利工会组织表示，菲亚特克莱斯勒（FCA）计划在4月27日恢复塞维尔工厂Ducato轻型商用车的生产，这比该国即将结束的封锁时间提前了一周的时间。事实上，意大利政府已收到大量的复工申请，目前正依靠地方政府的默许来加快进程。\n 同样，作为欧洲最大的汽车集团，大众汽车表示4月20日将恢复德国茨维考工厂的生产，斯洛伐克的布拉迪斯拉发工厂也将在这一天恢复运营。而德国沃尔夫斯堡、埃姆登和汉诺威的工厂以及葡萄牙、西班牙、俄罗斯和美国的工厂也将在4月27日恢复生产。\n 不过，前期的恢复生产还是分阶段进行的，车企也做了大量的工作来保障员工的安全距离。\n 根据计划，现代汽车将在复产后的捷克Nosovice工厂将实行两班制，而不是正常时期的三班制，以确保对工人采取适当的卫生保护措施。\n 为了确保员工和利益相关者的安全，丰田也为欧洲工厂的复产采取了谨慎的保护措施，包括地板上标记以确保一线工人的距离，并以更少人数的小组和更短的时间举行会议。\n 相比而言，北美地区有计划复工的工厂数量较少，福特和通用还没有明确的复工安排。\n 与此同时，虽然车企都在寻求积极复工的方式，但一部分车企还是遇到了来自内外部的阻力。\n 此前在3月27日，标致雪铁龙（PSA）表示已经向工会提交了健康保障方案，希望逐步重启其在欧洲的工厂，此前这些工厂因疫情传播而关闭。\n 不过这一建议遭到了工会的拒绝。CFTC工会成员Sebastien Leroy对媒体表示：只要疫情的高峰期还没有过去，讨论复工就为时尚早。\n 同时，恢复生产并不意味着情况就有所好转。受疫情影响，全球汽车消费需求持续低迷，即便本国疫情对生产影响较弱，但需求和订单减少，车企此时的开工也显得并不必要。\n 受需求减少的影响，丰田就计划在5月1日和11日停止国内的生产。此外，日本国内5家工厂的9条生产线也将在5月12日停工，最长持续至18日。而在开工的期间，丰田也将从平时的两班倒改为一班工作制，降低产量。\n 另外，受美国疫情影响，现代此前已关停了北美地区的工厂生产，而选择在韩国国内加紧生产并将其运往美国销售。\n 这样的举动对成本而言代价不菲，但美国的经销商也并不买账。知情人士透露，从韩国运往美国的汽车现在都停在美国港口，经销商因销售下滑和库存增加而迟迟不去提车。\n 同样，福特在本月早些时候还曾计划重新启动埃莫西洛组装工厂，并准备在4月14日恢复其他因新型冠状病毒爆发而停产的工厂的生产工作，但该公司日前却宣布无限期关闭北美部分工厂。\n 福特北美总裁库马尔·加尔霍特拉表示：福特目前的首要任务是确保员工、经销商、客户、合作伙伴和社区的健康和安全。\n 据《汽车新闻》网站报道，美国汽车工人联合会(UAW) 4月23日表示，5月初重启美国汽车生产对工人及其家人来说风险太大。\n 受疫情程度不同的影响，中国地区已经早于海外恢复生产。4月9日，发改委表示目前主要的国内汽车企业已经全面复工，日产量也逐步恢复到去年同期水平的75%以上。从经销商来看，经销商订单恢复到正常水平的65%以上。\n 随着国内企业陆续复工，大众、保时捷、宝马等跨国车企也都纷纷表示在华工厂和经销商已经基本恢复正常，中国地区的表现也成了巨头们关注的焦点。\n 保时捷全球执行董事会主席奥博穆更是强调，预计5月公司在中国市场的销售就能逐步回归正轨，而欧洲工厂的停工在短期内不会对中国市场产生影响。\n 而大众汽车集团CEO迪斯在3月底接受媒体采访时表示，大众除了在中国市场以外的地区没有销售或收入，在此期间，仍需承担高额的固定成本，每周约为20亿欧元。\n 据了解，大众乘用车品牌中国旗下2000家经销商已尽数恢复营业，客流量也于3月的最后一个周末达到了去年同期水平。\n 同时，中国不仅是汽车生产大国，也是汽车零部件的生产和出口大国，绝大部分的零部件都可以在国内采购配套，但也有极少部分的零部件需要进口。\n 发改委表示，虽然这段时间海外一些零部件的供应商受到疫情影响暂时停工，但是根据行业协会组织的调研情况看，目前国内企业进口零部件库存相对比较充裕。\n 罗兰贝格全球高级合伙人郑赟认为，汽车行业集群化、全球化的特点使全球以及中国的汽车产业都不可避免的受到一定程度冲击，但对于中国汽车行业来说则是危中有机、机大于危。\n 他指出，欧美疫情程度重、时间长的特点将对海外生产制造、营销服务企业带来较大的运营及资金挑战，中国企业有望通过国际合作、投资的方式增强自身能力：例如对于经销商的投资将能够帮助中国企业出海构建渠道，而对于高端零部件的投入，如燃料电池、动力总成等领域则可以帮助中国企业增强技术实力。\n 疫情到来或许打乱了全球以及中国汽车行业发展的节奏，但中国汽车市场的包容性和灵活性却必将持续为中国市场企业提供发展机遇，也为全球汽车行业发展提供坚实保障。郑赟强调。\n 不过，值得注意的是，全球疫情的影响目前还存在很多不确定因素。\n 上汽大众汽车有限公司销售与市场执行副总经理、上海上汽大众汽车销售有限公司总经理贾鸣镝认为，欧美地区长时间不复工，将会直接影响全球经济。\n 如果欧美的经济发生更大的问题，不光其本国失业率会急剧上升，对于出口需求也会急剧下降。企业、消费者的消费能力、消费信心，会产生一个连锁反应。经销商集团如果受到影响了，企业的财力人力，服务能力也会受影响。从终端客户到价值链都会受到整个全球经济的影响。他认为，长期来看也会对国内汽车市场产生深远影响"

    "content": "According to foreign media reports, Audi plans to gradually resume production in Europe in the coming weeks. To this end, the global production network, suppliers and service providers that will be restarted will coordinate with the public. The company has formulated a comprehensive set of measures for restarting production, with emphasis on ensuring the safety of employees.\n The company will follow the guidelines of the German Koch Institute for Disease Control and Prevention and the relevant regulations of the health authorities to carry out protection work. Earlier, due to the impact of the new coronavirus epidemic, Audi announced in mid-March to suspend production at its European plant.\n Peter Kosler, a member of the company's Production Management Committee, said that Audi will resume joint operations within Europe, mainly because the supply chain and production and logistics processes are closely linked within the group and with international partners. Kosler also emphasized that the focus of reinstatement is to create a safe working environment for employees.\n Therefore, the company's expert team adjusted the process in consultation with the special departments and working committees to achieve safety protection. Audi thanks all employees and partners around the world for their efforts.\n The chairman of the Labor-Management Committee Peter Mosh said that the health protection measures to protect employees are the focus of the first phase of resumption of work. While restarting production, Audi will provide a set of measures to ensure the health of employees.\n These measures include clearly stipulating the maintenance of social distances and hygiene requirements, improving the shift system to avoid contact, and requiring masks or face masks in places where the distance of 1.5 meters is impossible.\n The company also installed physical barriers in key workplaces. For example, in the production line of pre-installed doors, two employees are required to work face-to-face. At this time, a transparent barrier made of plastic film is used for protection. This barrier was also developed by Audi employees themselves.\n The management staff of the company's production department and working group, together with experts from occupational safety, health care, industrial engineering and trade unions, conducted investigations and analyses of all workplaces and made recommendations for improvement. Only with the approval of all personnel will the workplace be regarded as meeting the requirements for resumption of work during the epidemic.\n It is reported that the working group has also conducted a detailed study of the company's working environment, including group space, factory gates, parking spaces and internal factory transportation, as well as catering and factory restaurants. Audi has developed appropriate solutions for all locations.\n Employees will receive written notice of these measures in advance, and will receive comprehensive safety instructions from their respective department managers when they resume work. In addition, employees will receive regular updates through internal online media and factory notifications.\n Comprehensive safety measures and revised work regulations also apply to office premises. Office workers who do not need to work on-site are still likely to work from home to reduce the risk of infection. Restarting the factory directly affects employees in the production field.\n Vehicle production at the Audi plant will gradually resume according to a fixed plan from the end of April, and the production of its Gyr engine has gradually increased since last week. However, for those German factory employees who can only resume work only in the later stages of resumption, the short-term work regulations will continue to apply during this period"

The company said it had fully disinfected all facilities, which were closed a few weeks ago due to the outbreak of a new coronavirus.\n Sweden has recently relaxed its blockade policy during the epidemic. The head of the microbiology department of the country’s public health agency, Karin Tegmark Wiesel, said in an interview with Bloomberg on the 17th that the epidemic has eased in recent days. Although there are still new cases, they are generally stabilizing.\n Volvo CEO Hanken Samuelson said in a press release: Volvo is responsible for employees and suppliers, and once the situation permits, we will restart our business. In this case, the best thing we can do for society is to resume operations in a safe manner, thereby protecting the health and work of employees.\n The resumption statement issued by the company is as follows:\n Volvo's plant in Toslanda, Sweden, resumed production on April 20 (Monday). The plant had been temporarily suspended due to a new coronavirus outbreak.\n Volvo decided to resume operations after a dialogue with relevant unions. Office employees can resume normal work on the 20th. In recent weeks, factories and offices have been fully prepared to ensure the safety and health of employees.\n In addition, Volvo is engaged in continuous and close dialogue with all partners and suppliers to ensure continuous production and reduce supply chain interruptions. The company will also adjust the production capacity of the Toslanda plant to meet the needs of the market and existing orders.\n In a statement, the company emphasized that before employees return to work on the 20th, Volvo has fully disinfected all facilities, strengthened sanitation and disinfection procedures, and provided body temperature and pulse oximeter inspections at the main entrances.\n In recent weeks, the company's management personnel have conducted a detailed inspection of all workplaces in the Toslanda plant from a health and safety perspective, and have taken other protective measures in places where social distance cannot be maintained.\n The company has made the necessary adjustments to the layout of all meeting rooms, office spaces and restaurants to maintain social distance. For example, make sure desks and chairs are properly placed, and limit the number of meeting rooms and dining.\n In addition, the Ghent factory in Belgium in Volvo's global manufacturing network is also restarted on April 20, but production will decline. The company currently plans to resume production at its South Carolina plant on May 11.\n The engine plant in Schöfde, Sweden and the body part manufacturing plant of Olofstr m will also continue to produce weekly and adjust to the needs of other plants. Office staff in other markets will continue to follow local guidelines, but Volvo’s health and safety management hopes that the lessons learned from the Swedish production facilities can be implemented in other regions.\n It is reported that Volvo will continue to use the support plan launched by the Swedish government earlier this year, which means that the working hours of most employees will continue to shrink. Government support allows Volvo to protect its basic health business before the market stabilizes"

    "content": "According to foreign media reports, Volkswagen announced on April 20 local time that its plant in Brazil will be closed until the end of this month, but the company has not yet decided whether to resume production operations at the plant in May or later.\n Volkswagen said the company had just reached a preliminary agreement with the union to keep the workers’ net wage income unchanged. Although the total wages will be reduced, the Brazilian government will make up the difference through subsidies.\n If the agreement is approved, Volkswagen’s workers will be in a better position than their rival GM workers. The latter has a salary reduction of up to 25%, which also includes subsidies issued by the Brazilian government in response to the new coronavirus epidemic.\n Affected by the new coronavirus epidemic, almost all of the automaker's plants in Brazil have ceased production. But as production interruptions intensify, companies have been discussing how to cut wage costs.\n These automakers are also actively lobbying the Brazilian federal government to provide emergency loans because most companies do not have enough cash on hand to pay for several months of wage expenses. According to Reuters, the automaker's loan amount is as high as 133 billion yuan, but the Brazilian government's approval of this request has not yet been guaranteed. The president of the Brazilian National Development Bank said on the 19th that negotiations between the Brazilian government and automakers are expected to be completed in May. The bank will issue loans on behalf of the Brazilian government.\n VW union workers voted on the proposal on April 20, and the vote lasted until the end of the day.\n Although most industries are still in a state of suspension, tire maker Pirelli said on the 20th that the company is resuming production at two small factories in Brazil, which have taken social distances and other health measures."

Power is designed to analyze the impact of COVID-19 on the automotive industry, and it is expected that this will be the first such report released weekly. It uses data from China as a benchmark. The outbreak in China is relatively serious, but progress has been made in combating the outbreak.\n The report pointed out that: unlike flight seats and food, cars are durable goods, and have always been able to make up for the loss of sales caused by short-term supply disruptions. Therefore, the automotive industry is likely to recover from virus-related sales disruptions.\n The U.S. auto market's sales in March alone have dropped by about 38,000 units. This decline continued to heat up this week, and the decline is expected to continue throughout March.\n J.D. Power pointed out in the report that car sales across the United States have declined to varying degrees. For example, Seattle has fallen by 18%, and San Francisco, Sacramento, Detroit and Minneapolis have all decreased by 17%, but car sales will still face pressure.\n The report said: The business activities during the weekend were very weak, and it is expected that in the remainder of March, consumer demand for car consumption will further weaken.\n J.D. Power pointed out that a bright spot in the automotive sales industry may be vehicle leasing, of which 1.8 million vehicles will expire in March to July, this part of the car users may return to the exhibition hall to buy vehicles"

    "title": "The epidemic will cause UK car production to fall by more than 15% this year",
    "content": "According to foreign media reports, on March 27, the British Automobile Manufacturers and Traders Association (SMMT) said that the outbreak of the new coronavirus epidemic will lead to a reduction of more than 15% of UK car production this year. If the factory has to continue to close the number In May, the decline in output will further expand. The organization urged the British government to take more measures in this regard.\n The automotive industry is the UK’s largest merchandise export industry, employing more than 800,000 employees, while Jaguar Land Rover and Nissan’s plants in central and northern England account for more than half of the UK’s total production. This outbreak has caused a large number of factories to suspend operations. With the British government taking all possible measures to limit the spread of the epidemic, it is unclear when the closed factories will resume work.\n SMMT said that it had previously expected that the UK's auto production will slightly decrease to 1.27 million vehicles this year, and it is now expected to be further reduced to 1.06 million. This is still under the situation that the zero-tariff agreement reached between the UK and the EU will take effect on January 1 next year.\n SMMT said: If the epidemic and the factory closure continue for several months, the impact will be much more severe than it is now. SMMT CEO Mike Hawes said: If we want to maintain the vitality of the automotive industry and help the UK regain its footing, we urgently need to release funds and take additional measures to alleviate the pressure on cash flow. How it works.\n Automakers want to make up for part of the lost demand, and it depends on when they can restart production. In the first two months of this year, British car production fell by 1.5%.\n In addition to the epidemic, British automakers are also facing uncertainty caused by Brexit. In addition, the decline in diesel vehicle sales, electrification, stricter emission regulations, and investment in autonomous driving are all issues that British automakers need to face.\n Last week, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson called on companies to help fight the epidemic. Automakers, including Ford, participated in an organization producing medical ventilators. Hawes said: The entire automotive industry is ready to help the country, from the production of basic medical equipment to the continuous supply of basic materials, such as the provision and maintenance of emergency services vehicles, the transportation of key personnel, etc."

    "content": "文 |  James\n 随着疫情对海外车企影响的加剧，已经停产接近半个月的海外汽车制造工厂到目前仍未达到复工条件。北美地区的69座整车厂已有55座暂时关闭停产，关闭比例达到80%；欧洲则更加严重，仅大众集团一家车企在欧洲就关停了72座工厂，复工时间也在不断推后。\n 不过，在疫情期间，车企的固定成本却一分都不能少，其中很大一部分用于员工的工资。车企失去了收入还需要大量支出，资金流动逐渐成为一大难题，部分车企甚至已经经营困难。大众集团每周固定成本就需要20亿欧元（约合157.2亿元人民币），公司资金状况正在逐渐恶化，资金流动性下降。因此，支出和亏损降到最低已经成为车企的当务之急。\n 近日，大众集团、福特汽车、通用汽车、FCA等车企以及租车公司Hertz、安飞士等都发布了裁员降薪计划，继中国车企裁员降薪之后，海外车企也开始大幅削减成本。目前，几家海外车企都发布了降薪措施，同时还制定了裁员计划，如果情况进一步恶化，就会通过裁员断臂求生。\n ▲全球汽车和出行行业裁员、降薪统计\n 目前，美国三大车企福特汽车、通用汽车、FCA高管甚至普通员工全部降薪，降薪幅度至少20%。租车公司Hertz和安飞士订单量大幅减少，目前已经制定好裁员计划，公司高管也集体降薪。此外，大众集团已经表示可能采取裁员行动。\n 在新冠肺炎疫情持续于欧美肆虐之际，一场裁员降薪潮正在欧美汽车产业上演。\n 大众亏22亿 德国10万汽车人面临失业\n 3月以来，欧洲全境新冠肺炎不断蔓延，目前已经覆盖所有欧洲国家。根据世界卫生组织公布的数据，截至欧洲中部时间3月31日18:00（北京时间4月1日1:00），意大利、西班牙的确诊人数分别为10万和8.5万，确诊人数已经超过中国。此外，欧洲主要工业国德国的确诊人数突破6万，法国也达到4.3万，疫情形势还在继续恶化。\n 作为全球销量最大的车企，大众集团受疫情影响已经十分明显。据统计，大众集团在全球范围内共有124家工厂，61.7万名员工。其中，欧洲有72家工厂，占到全部工厂的一半以上。从本月开始，大众在全球范围内停工停产，欧洲、北美的大众集团工厂全部关停，目前还不清楚具体复工时间。\n 近日，大众集团首席执行官Herbert Diess在接受德国电视频道ZDF采访的时候，就对大众目前的经营状况向外界进行说明。\n 他表示，受新冠肺炎疫情影响，大众集团在中国以外地区的销售全部暂停，不过每周20亿欧元（约合157.2亿元人民币）的固定成本一分都不能少。\n ▲大众集团首席执行官Herbert Diess（右）\n 此外，大众集团首席财务官Frank Witter近日对英国《金融时报》表示，大众集团如果遇到危急时刻，还可以通过发行债券的方式度过危机。\n 目前，大众集团可以在其融资计划中最多发行150亿欧元（约合1179亿元人民币）的债务，另外还可以面向比利时发行50亿欧元（约合393亿元人民币）的短期债务。此外，大众集团金融服务部门还可独立发行最多25亿欧元（约合196.5亿元人民币）的债券。\n 三项合计，大众集团大约还能发行225亿欧元（约合1751亿元人民币）的债券。不过，当大众集团真的一点余粮都没有的时候，这些债券也只能再维持大约3个月时间。\n 近日，外媒德国新闻社发表了一篇德国汽车行业研究专家Ferdinand Dudenhoeffer的文章，文章中说，德国汽车制造行业面临产量连年下滑、产量过剩的问题。受疫情影响，汽车在德国本土的生产、销售几乎停摆，出口也大幅下滑，车企将面临巨额亏损。预计今年德国汽车行业的失业人数可能达到10万人。\n Dudenhoeffer认为，近年来，德国汽车产量连年减少，汽车制造行业正处于低谷。据统计，2019年德国新车产量为466万辆，较2016年已经减少100多万辆。而在此次疫情期间，德国国内的汽车产销已基本停摆，第二、第三产业停工停产近半个月，目前还没有任何好转的迹象。\n ▲大众集团位于德国的一家整车厂\n 此外，德国汽车行业还面临无法出口的问题。根据慕尼黑大学莱布尼兹经济研究所预计，3月份德国出口量将下降19.8%，为2009年5月以来的最低单月出口量，同时也创下柏林墙倒塌后出口最大单月跌幅。\n 而德国本土汽车制造业中，70%以上的新车都会出口，因此汽车制造行业的出口压力比内销压力更加巨大。\n Dudenhoeffer预计，今年德国新车销量将减少15%，大约在300万辆左右；新车产量将大跌，预计仅有380万辆。不过，这还是乐观的情况，Dudenhoeffer认为今年德国新车产量最少仅有340万辆，相当于在2019年的基础上再减少100万辆，产量下跌27%。\n 另据欧洲汽车工业协会（ACEA）发布的报告，截至3月31日，欧洲229家汽车组装工厂平均停产时间已达16天，目前已有111万汽车制造业工人的工作受到影响。其中，德国作为欧洲最大的汽车制造国，有56.8万人汽车制造工人的工作受到影响，约占受影响总人数的51%。\n 通用全球降薪20% 福特已做好裁员计划\n 地表最强的制造业大国德国都尚且如此，其他国家的制造业更是面临重重困境。根据世界卫生组织公布的数据，美国新冠肺炎确诊病例已经超过14万人，疫情严重程度已经超过中国。据美国汽车创新联盟发布的数据，北美地区的69家整车厂中已有55家暂时关闭，关停比例已经达到80%，美国整车厂已经关闭93%。\n ▲截至3月26日北美整车厂关停情况\n 目前，美国三大车企通用汽车、福特汽车和菲亚特克莱斯勒汽车（以下简称FCA）已经全部停产，停产时间已近半月，每天都有固定成本支出，停产面临的损失在逐渐加大。最近，虽然几家车企近日获批生产医疗用品，但生产这些产品确实无法解决车企的困境。\n 此前，美国三大车企曾计划在3月30日复工，不过就目前的情况看，都没有复工的迹象。此前福特将旗下四家工厂的复工日期延迟到最早4月6日，另外5家工厂则推迟到4月14日复工。3月31日，福特再次发布消息，北美所有工厂都无限期停工，直至疫情得到有效控制。\n 停工导致车企的经营陷入困境，通用汽车从3月24日起采取紧缩措施，并筹措大量现金应对危机。此外，美国三大车企也通过不同渠道放出消息，降低公司的运营成本，\n 近日，CNBC的一篇报道显示，福特汽车首席执行官Jim Hackett在3月26日向全球员工发送了一封信件。他表示，福特的目标是在不裁员的前提之下应对危机，目前还没有任何福特员工的工作处于危险状态。\n 不过，如果新冠肺炎疫情再次加剧，福特可能将会采取更多的行动，以保证公司的正常运营。\n ▲福特F-150皮卡整车工厂\n 福特汽车根据目前的运营状况已经制定出成本压缩计划。从5月1日起，福特300名高管将会降薪，降薪幅度为20%~50%不等，降薪时间最少5个月。福特汽车董事长Bill Ford在此期间没有薪资，在公司运营正常后补发。另外，福特所有员工的加班加薪、绩效加薪推迟发放，公司暂停招聘新员工。\n 同时，福特汽车首席执行官Hackett也承诺，现阶段不会采取裁员措施。不过他表示，如果疫情进一步恶化，福特长时间无法进行产销工作，裁员无法避免。\n 3月26日，通用汽车发布内部公告称，公司需要立即采取措施削减成本，其中包括对所有正式员工减薪，但暂时没有裁员的通知。通用汽车计划对不同层次的员工采取不同的减薪策略。\n ▲通用汽车整车工厂\n 首先是通用汽车全球范围内6.9万名正式员工。从4月1日起，每人薪资减少20%，降薪持续约6个月。目前，通用汽车正式员工占员工总数的42%，非正式员工受到的保障可能更少。\n 针对通用汽车的高管，从4月1日起，高级领导人员薪资将降低30%，其他高管的薪资降低25%，通用汽车董事会成员薪资降低20%。\n 通用汽车承诺，减薪期间，员工的医疗保健福利不会受到影响。对于普通员工和部分高管，2021年3月15日前将会补发目前暂时扣除的工资。不过，董事会成员降薪的部分不会补发。\n 此外，由于通用汽车美国工厂约有6500名工程和制造工人目前无法工作，而且都是正式员工。这部分工人目前处于请假在家的状态，停工期间可以领到75%的薪资。\n 据外媒路透社报道，FCA首席执行官Mike Manley的一份备忘录显示，从4月1日起，FCA也将采取为期三个月的降薪措施。\n ▲FCA首席执行官Mike Manley上月曾到美国皮卡整车厂参观\n 其中，FCA首席执行官Mike Manley的薪资将降低50%。FCA董事长John Elkann和董事会成员从4月1日起将停发薪资，直至明年初。FCA执行委员会的19名成员将降薪30%。此外，FCA全球范围内的大多数员工也将临时减薪20%。\n Manley表示，FCA希望公司的员工不受当地停工的影响，临时减薪20%就是为了避免裁员。不过，他没有承诺何时会补发这部分工资。\n 租车巨头订单暴跌 安飞士高管集体降薪\n 新冠肺炎疫情蔓延中，最受伤的就是制造和服务行业。制造业车企不断传出裁员的消息，服务业的出行公司同样不能幸免。近日，美国两家大型租车公司Hertz和安飞士就宣布将削减运营成本。同时，一些自动驾驶公司的必要测试工作也于本月中旬暂停。截至目前，停工对自动驾驶公司的影响尚不明显。\n 租车公司Hertz从3月21日开始暂停运营，目前已经停运一周多的时间。受新冠肺炎疫情影响，Hertz的租车服务已经基本停摆。\n Hertz公司首席执行官Kathryn Marinello近日表示，目前公司已经开始裁员以保证正常运营。Hertz公司首席运营官Paul Stone在发给员工的一封信中说：我们从来没有经历过如此大规模的停摆事件，这对我们的业务产生了非常深远的影响。我们已经目睹了北美急剧下降的出行需求。\n Hertz公司将会解雇部分员工，且不会发放失业补助，但会保留被解雇员工的医疗福利。此外，部分可供出租的车辆也暂停运营。\n 而另一家租车公司安飞士则面临更严重的经营压力。安飞士在其官方网站说，受疫情影响，今年4月各项业务的预定量下降60%，因此公司需要调整运营计划。\n ▲安飞士发表降低运营成本的声明\n 安飞士表示，今年的目标是减少4亿美元（约合28亿元人民币）的运营成本。其中，领导团队、高级员工减薪，同时还会裁员。\n 受疫情影响，网约车公司Alto、Lyft、Uber的订单量大幅下降，网约车司机的收入面临中断的风险。Alto公司创始人兼首席执行官Will Coleman近日表示，业务量在3月出现暴跌，几天之内乘客数量就下降了75%。\n 近日，Alto公司在其网站上更新了信息，建议网约车驾驶员与当地商户、企业达成合作，在运营网约车的同时，也兼职做当地配送员。这样既可以缓解当地配送服务的压力，还能缓解司机收入下降的问题。\n ▲Alto在其网站首页的送货服务广告\n 此外，网约车公司Lyft也宣布，将和旧金山湾区政府机构和非营利组织合作，开始试行送餐服务。此外，Lyft向网约车司机发送的邮件显示，如果司机收入遇到困难，建议到亚马逊公司工作，因为亚马逊正在招聘10万名配送员工。\n 而出行服务公司Uber一直以来鼓励网约车司机既当司机，又当配送员。因此，在疫情期间，Uber表示，送餐需求正在成倍上涨。\n Uber公司Eats送餐服务部门负责人Pierre-Dimitri Gore-Coty近日表示，Uber的送餐服务没有收到疫情的影响，反而人们越来越依赖送餐服务。\n 当地时间3月17日，在加利福尼亚州进行自动驾驶测试的Waymo，Cruise和ArgoAI三家公司先后宣布暂停需要车内安全员参与的自动驾驶测试，以防止疫情持续扩散。\n Waymo将暂停旗下Waymo One乘车服务，同时，需要车内安全员的自动驾驶测试也暂停进行。不过，Waymo表示，完全无人驾驶的测试项目不会中断，保证当地的货物运输不受影响。\n ▲Cruise自动驾驶汽车\n 通用汽车旗下自动驾驶公司Cruise表示，目前Cruise已暂停运营，预计三周以后复工。Cruise首席人力资源官Arden Hoffman说，在停工期间，Cruise将为员工发放工作日的全额工资。\n 此外，福特汽车自动驾驶子公司ArgoAI也表示，目前已经暂停了自动驾驶车辆测试，但公司没有因为疫情受到任何重大影响。\n 不过，由于自动驾驶公司大多都是砸钱的项目，即使是可以载客运营，也不能向乘客收费。或许这就是自动驾驶公司暂时没有受到影响的原因吧。\n 结语：疫情对全球经济的影响逐渐加深\n 疫情之下，全球各大车企积极帮助抗疫，但长时间的停工停产也让实力雄厚的车企有些吃不消。3月初，我国自主车企也出现了较大规模的降薪潮，而随着复工复产工作的进行，降薪裁员这样迫不得已的行动也将逐渐消退。\n 如今，全球新冠肺炎确诊患者已经超过70万，疫情对全球经济的影响将逐渐深入。这需要每一个个体、每一个政府以及其他组织共同努力，早日战胜疫情，迎来今年真正的春天"

It is worth mentioning that initially these measures only affected production workers.\n Although during the pandemic of the new coronavirus, many automakers cut executive salaries and temporarily dismissed factory employees, there were relatively few temporary dismissals of paid workers. According to a spokesperson, Honda will continue to pay medical insurance and other benefits for employees who are temporarily laid off, and they will be eligible for national unemployment benefits.\n Honda said in a statement: Many city and state home orders restrict consumers from buying new cars.

The move aims to curb the spread of the new coronavirus epidemic. It is worth mentioning that the Japanese government had previously allowed to keep the workplace open to maintain economic operation.\n Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe allowed the manufacturing plant to continue operating in an emergency. He declared a state of emergency in some parts of Japan within this month, and expanded the area of ​​application of the state of emergency last week. As global demand plummeted, Nissan and its competitors have suspended production at many factories.\n Nissan is the latest Japanese company to close its global headquarters to reduce the number of employees commuting. The number of people infected with the new coronavirus in Japan this week increased to about 11,000. Canon and Toshiba announced similar measures earlier this month.\n Nissan said that starting next Monday, 15,000 employees at its headquarters in Yokohama and the main R&D center near Matsugi City, Kanagawa Prefecture will be required to take 16 days of vacation until the Japanese Golden Week holiday that begins on May 4.\n A Nissan spokesman said that the company headquarters will be closed to all employees except those necessary.

The deal, led by the Bavarian State Bank (Bayerische Landesbank), was completed last week.\n When BMW returns to the bond market, it is precisely the spread of the new crown virus that has inhibited the development of the global economy and caused a serious blow to consumer demand for car purchases. BMW plans to suspend production at its South Carolina plant from April 3, which is BMW's largest plant. On March 20, BMW suspended production at its plants in Roslin, Europe and South Africa. The shutdown will continue until April 19, and the British operations of the Mini and Rolls-Royce brands will also be suspended. In addition, the Dutch company Nedcar has also suspended production. The company is responsible for the production of some Mini and BMW models.\n BMW’s current financial and liquidity conditions are stable, with no significant changes compared to the end of last year. The company said it has no intention to use its revolving loan of 8 billion euros, which will expire in July 2023.\n So far, other automakers, including Daimler, Ford, General Motors and Toyota, have sought financial support from banks to respond to the crisis caused by the epidemic. Some of these companies have used billions of dollars in revolving loans, and some seek more credit lines"

    "content": "According to foreign media reports, Hyundai hopes to provide customers with a guarantee plan again during the epidemic to establish a brand image and continue the goodwill created since the Great Depression.\n It is reported that Hyundai intends to restart a plan called Hyundai Insurance Unemployment Insurance, which was first launched in the US market in 2009 to improve Hyundai’s brand awareness and good corporate reputation. The plan will be over the next 10 years Successfully made Hyundai a mainstream brand in the American automotive market.\n Angela Zepeda, chief marketing officer of Hyundai American, said: Hyundai has always upheld the concept of'we are together' and feels that it needs to do something to show people that Hyundai knows they are being hurt. If Hyundai can provide assistance with car payments, we should do so.\n Hyundai's 2009 guarantee plan is a novel and bold plan designed to attract Americans who fell into recession after the financial market collapsed. The core of Hyundai's plan is: Hyundai owners can return their vehicles if they are unemployed.\n Hyundai did not disclose how many vehicles were actually returned at that time, but in any case, Hyundai's market share in the United States jumped from 3.1% in the first ten months of 2009 to 4.3% in the same period last year.\n In response to this severe global epidemic, Hyundai once again made it clear that between March 14 and April 30 this year, consumers who have lost their jobs can enjoy up to six through modern financial services when buying or renting vehicles Monthly installment service.\n Hyundai will also provide APR loans with a zero interest rate and 120-day deferred payments through Hyundai Financial Services Agency according to customers’ requirements before April 30, while Hyundai Financial’s existing customers will be unemployed before April 30. Or face difficulties related to medicine, which can be extended up to three months.\n Zepeda said that the biggest difference between the new guarantee plan and the previous one is that consumers were able to return the car last time, but this time Hyundai hopes that consumers can keep their cars.\n This is a great plan, especially under the influence of the epidemic, consumers may be more alert to the public health safety of car sharing services or public transportation. It is important to have a little freedom, and cars will give consumers freedom.\n Under the current circumstances, various car brands have adopted different marketing methods to respond to the new coronavirus crisis. For example, Toyota and Lexus placed some TV ads that felt good, but did not attach any specific promotional activities; Fiat Chrysler and Buick have begun to provide online transactions through social networks and media ads.\n Hyundai has also begun to broadcast simple and easy-to-understand TV commercials to emphasize the new modern insurance business.\n Zepeda said that for us, we need to take action to show consumers that during this time, we are doing our best to support them. Hyundai will always look for various options and friendly and flexible ways in the new guarantee plan.\n We are open-minded and know that we cannot fully control (epidemic crisis), so we will make consumers feel a real offer in the way we enter the market.\n According to reports, in response to the new coronavirus epidemic, Hyundai’s charitable organizations donated 2 million US dollars (about 141.65 billion yuan) to establish a vehicle detection system at Washington Children’s Hospital to directly drive vehicles for new coronaviruses.

    "content": "文/毕然\n 去年5月，曾给戴姆勒留下不可磨灭印记、蓄有标志性海象胡须的蔡澈正式退位，他的职位由康林松接任。\n 对不少汽车圈儿内的人来说，在2018年以前，康林松这个名字并不足够熟悉，尽管现年50岁的他已在戴姆勒集团工作近27年。\n 作为戴姆勒首位非德国籍的掌门人，康林松的表现自然更加受到大家的关注。\n 有业内人士曾开玩笑一般说，康林松并没有赶上好时候。一方面，全球经济和汽车市场正处于相对低迷时期；另一方面，2020年开局的突发疫情，也令原本就处于寒冬的汽车行业雪上加霜。\n 对于业务的进一步影响取决于疫情的整体走向，现阶段做出全面评估还为时尚早。对戴姆勒所有人来说，目前最重要的事情就是抗击全球疫情。\n 但对于康松林来说，每一天都是宝贵的，他所做出的每一个决策都有可能影响戴姆勒的业务发展。\n 对于2020年和不远的未来，我认为以下战略行动领域尤为重要：业务表现，电气化，数字化，这些领域紧密相连。尽管上任还未满一年，但对于企业未来的发展方向，康松林的内心早已有了盘算，为了推动这三大领域的实质性进展，我们加大了对新技术的投资。我们下定决心要确保在技术上的领先优势，同时大力提升盈利能力。\n 就在上个月，戴姆勒正式发布了2019财年业绩。\n 数据显示，2019财年，戴姆勒集团汽车总销量达334万辆；营业额增长3%，达1727亿欧元。其中，梅赛德斯-奔驰乘用车售出2385400 辆新车，较去年有小幅增长；营业额增至939亿欧元。\n 乍看之下，表现还算不错。但仔细观察数据后不难发现，其息税前利润从2018年的111亿欧元跌落至43亿欧元，净利润也下滑64.5%至27亿欧元。或许这正是令康林松说出我们对2019财年业绩表现不尽满意这句话的原因所在。\n 利润下滑，与其产品销售构成脱不开干系，产品结构变化也成为了影响其利润率下滑的重要因素。毕竟只有在高端乘用车市场保持可持续增长，增速高于整体市场，才能最大限度促进利润的增加。而戴姆勒集团销量增长的同时，其高价车型销量占比并没有得到同步提升。\n 另一方面，据外媒报道，梅赛德斯-奔驰的产品阵容还将继续缩减，大型豪华轿车S级的敞篷版和轿跑、B级轿车的未来或许都将充满不确定性。如此一来，倚靠销售豪华车为企业带来高额利润将变得更加有难度。\n 所幸，面对挑战，康林松也做好了应对之策：用必要的措施增强财务实力，为实现未来战略夯实基础。我们的中长期目标包括精简集团架构、提高效率和应变能力，并进一步挖掘业务潜力。我们正在实行大幅增效举措，这不是简单的削减成本，而是要提高竞争力、强化创新力、增强投资力。\n 目前，戴姆勒已在所有业务领域开展的大力增效举措，包括缩减人力和材料成本、调整产品阵容和车型、推进平台战略以及更紧缩的资本配置，期望通过这些务实方案改善盈利水平。\n 至于能否借此实现在2021年以前，将梅赛德斯-奔驰的主要汽车业务恢复到8-10%的盈利区间，而其重型卡车和公共汽车业务的目标是实现8%的可持续回报的目标，或许还需要时间来给予答案。\n 去年年中，戴姆勒集团发布了使命2039战略，其中提到：到2030年，电动汽车（纯电动汽车与插电式混合动力车）的销量将占戴姆勒汽车总销量的50%；到2039年实现全线产品碳中和。如果按一个产品周期6-7年计算，戴姆勒集团要在三个产品周期内建立一支碳中和的新型车队。\n 在这场新能源汽车大战中，奔驰来的并不算早，至少在中国市场上，它的起步显得稍微晚了些。去年问世的EQC，也可视为是奔驰电动化转型的一个标志。\n 不过，坊间对EQC的评价风向也不完全相同。有认为来的恰逢其时的，也有认为是过渡产品的。毕竟这并不是一款在全新平台上生产出的产品。在被宝马iNEXT和奥迪e-tron前后夹击的当下，用这样一款产品来试水技术和市场、缩短研发周期、为抢占市场做准备，并无不妥。\n 但康林松也清楚的明白，这并非长久之计。去年下半年，奔驰宣布将在产品发展路线上进行重大调整，将对未来所有研发的车型持续进行电动化开发。\n 目前，除smart EQ、EQC、EQV等纯电车型外，EQA纯电SUV也已在瑞典完成冬季测试，今年年内将与消费者见面。同时，全新腾势X已于2020年初开始交付，戴姆勒与吉利控股集团正式成立smart品牌全球合资公司的新一代智能电动车型，预计将从2022年开始在全球销售。\n 此外，戴姆勒还在推48V智能电机技术和插电混合动力技术，计划到2020年底实现这类轻混车型销量翻番，插电式混合动力和纯电车型的销量占比达到此前的四倍。\n 未来的车型平台将遵循‘电动优先’的原则。车辆架构将根据纯电车型的需求研发，并可以适配插电混动车型和内燃机车型。与部分企业全面电动化的布局不同，戴姆勒选择的是EQ Boost、EQ Power与EQ三管齐下的新能源策略，将纯电、混动和插电混动技术都列入其中。\n 把鸡蛋放在多个篮子里，的确有利于规避风险，但另一方面，如何进行资源分配也成为了另一道难题。特别是在利润不断缩水的如今，如何为电动化转型提供充足的资金支持也是康松林必须解决的问题。\n 转型，痛还是痛并快乐着？如人饮水，冷暖自知"

    "content": "文/毕然\n 对于迪斯而言，2019年是他职业史上留下最浓烈印记的一年。\n 就迪斯个人而言，2018年4月，他接任大众汽车集团管理董事会主席一职，并继续兼任大众汽车乘用车品牌董事会主席，成为带领大众汽车前行的舵手，掌握着企业前进的方向。\n 一周前，受到疫情影响，大众汽车集团2020年度媒体年会以线上直播的方式举行，62岁的迪斯正式交出了自己上任以来第一个完整财年的考卷。\n 对大众汽车集团而言，旗下几乎所有品牌的业绩表现在2019财年都实现了提升。集团的销售收入和营业利润均实现增长，汽车业务的净现金流和净流动资金也显著攀升。\n 数据显示，2019财年大众汽车集团销量达1097.46万辆，同比增长1.3%；全年销售收入达到2526亿欧元，同比增长7.1%。其中，未计入特殊项目支出的营业利润增至193亿欧元，同比增长12.8%；未计入特殊项目支出的营业销售回报率为7.6%。\n 现金流，是衡量企业生存能力和发展的重要因素，是体现企业发展优劣的一个重要指标。2019财年，大众汽车集团汽车业务净现金流增长至108亿欧元，净流动资产增至213亿欧元。\n 2019年是大众汽车集团非常成功的一年，为全面变革奠定了重要基础。市场下行的大趋势中，大众汽车仍能呈现增长态势，进一步扩大市场份额，一系列飘红的数字都是对迪斯们做出的决策的肯定。\n 电动化豪赌 赶超特斯拉？\n 销售、营收取得 阶段性胜利的同时，大众汽车集团也在加速电动化的转型步伐。但对于大众汽车集团这头大象而言，转身并没有那么容易。\n 只是，当销量远不及大众的特斯拉市值一度超过大众时，也从另一角度反映出了资本市场对电动化未来发展前景的看好。\n 此前在面对特斯拉时，大众曾表示要实现超越。迪斯在日前接受媒体采访时也表示，特斯拉作为行业先行者，大众是紧密追随者，要尽可能追赶上特斯拉的发展步伐。\n 追赶也好，超越也罢，都体现出了特斯拉们对大众们已形成了巨大的竞争压力。换言之，特斯拉等造车新势力也是推动大众等巨头们加速转型的催化剂。\n 汽车行业的未来是电动化的，大众汽车集团从保时捷Taycan、奥迪e-tron这样的高端产品开始，这是最符合经济效益的，随后推出ID.3这样的大众化产品，这能够为我们通向零排放的移动出行铺垫道路。 作为2019年战略转型的重点，全系产品电动化可以说是迪斯变革的抓手，而且布局路径清晰，也已取得了实质性的进展。\n 近两年，大众汽车集团不断提速对电动化的布局。按照规划，到2022年，大众汽车集团将在全球拥有8个MEB（模块化电驱动平台）工厂。其中位于上海和佛山的两座工厂年内将正式投产，届时大众将在中国新增每年60万辆纯电动汽车的生产能力。\n 具体到产品层面，迪斯透露说，目前保时捷Taycan电动超跑已经有15000个订单，奥迪e-tron已经在市场上销售了32000辆。截止今年初的数据是，奥迪e-tron在德国和挪威的市场份额已经超过了特斯拉，成为高档电动车的第一名。在美国市场，大众已经建立了40个充电站，仅次于特斯拉。\n 今明两年时间，大众计划推出33款新能源汽车，其中包括15款纯电动车型和18款混合动力车型。中国市场将成为大众汽车集团电动化转型的重点市场，未来该集团将有50%以上的纯电动汽车销量来自中国。\n 疫情不会影响大众汽车集团电气化战略的推进。迪斯说， 2020年-2024年，大众汽车集团将向混合动力、电气化和数字化领域投入600亿欧元，其中330亿欧元用于电气化领域支出。大众汽车集团计划到2029年推出至多75款电动汽车和60款混合动力汽车，预计届时电动汽车销量将增加至2600万辆。其中，2000万辆电动汽车将产自大众MEB平台，剩余的多数将基于PPE平台打造。\n 据悉，大众汽车集团的MEB平台将在2022年底前为旗下的大众、奥迪、斯柯达和西亚特品牌提供27款电动汽车的支持。\n 大众汽车集团希望能在未来三年内销售100万辆无排放汽车，令自身超过特斯拉和其他电动汽车品牌先行者。\n 2020年，大众集团集团依然会坚持电动化转型战略。迪斯透露说，尽管受到疫情的影响，ID.3暂时停止生产，但研发是不停止的，相信ID.3在今年夏天能顺利交付。\n 艰难的一年 要向中国学习\n 就眼下而言，所有汽车企业都面临一个共同的挑战：疫情。面对疫情，谁都无法独善其身。\n 受疫情影响，不少车企已陆续关闭了全球部分地区的生产，停工停产对企业发展造成的影响不言而喻。\n 目前，位于西班牙、葡萄牙赛图巴尔、斯洛伐克伯拉第斯拉瓦的大众汽车品牌工厂，以及位于意大利的兰博基尼和杜卡迪品牌工厂都已暂时停产，位于德国和欧洲其他区域的工厂大多数也都在为停产做准备，停产时间约为两周。\n 大众汽车集团劳资联合委员会称，在工厂工作的员工之间不可能保持安全距离，因此建议用暂停生产方式来阻断病毒传播。\"各个独立品牌将尽快沟通运营计划的细节。\" 迪斯说。\n 所幸，大众关闭欧洲各地工厂的同时，其在中国的多家工厂已陆续复工。\n 根据预计，在今年剩下的时间里，销量有可能复苏。 对于中国市场的前景，迪斯表现得相当乐观, 大众在中国的工厂几乎都在运营，销量也在回升。我们仍然认为，今年在中国可能会是不错的一年。\n 在迪斯看来，中国对于疫情的阻击以及中国工厂的管理经验，为大众汽车集团抗击疫情带来了很好的经验，也将有助于其快速恢复生产。我们应该学习中国经验，保护好员工，共同渡过新冠病毒带来的危机。\n 面对不确定的2020年，中国市场或许是迪斯最确定的区域。综合种种因素，迪斯预计今年中国市场销量将下滑3%。迪斯肯定地表示，大众将进一步努力加大在中国市场的地位。但至于是否会谋求在中国合资公司当中更多的股份，迪斯认为与合资伙伴之间的关系不会受到此次疫情的过多影响和变化。\n 2020年将是非常艰难的一年，新冠疫情给我们的业务和财务带来了未知的挑战，它对经济的持续性影响也令人担忧。对于2020年，我们现在没有办法做出准确的预测。我们不知道疫情会维持多久，产生多大的后果。目前我们处于应急抗灾情况，最重要的是想尽办法让工作和流程加以稳定。在迪斯看来，中国已经陆续恢复到正轨，但现在谈欧洲的预测还为时过早。\n 但大众汽车集团仍有努力的目标何方向。根据预计，2020 年大众汽车集团汽车业务的研发及资本支出占销售收入的比率预计将在6.0%至6.5%之间。受柴油发动机排放事件的影响，集团在2020年仍将持续支出此部分现金，同时因企业并购带来的现金支出也将大幅增加。\n 因此，大众汽车集团预计在 2020 年净现金流会继续保持正向增长，但整体水平将低于去年。排除柴油发动机排放事件和并购活动的影响，集团2020财年将继续以实现至少100亿欧元的净现金流为目标。\n 不过，对2020年，迪斯仍然保持积极的态度，他相信不久的将来就会出现正面的信号，不用过于悲观，我相信我们有能力渡过这个艰难的年度。\n 有人说，时势造英雄，也有人说，是英雄造就了时势。当疫情过去我们回过头来看的时候，或许将有更为明确的答案。2020年，尽管我们面对的是一个困难重重的开局，但好在一切正逐步向好的方向发展，只有做好自己的事儿，才能让企业不断向前，保持市场的领先地位"

    "title": "Dialogue with Gao Le: The more severe the global situation, the more BMW must strengthen its \"Chinese heart\"",
    "content": "Text / Yang Guang\n A few years ago, all circles advocated following the trend and not moving against the trend.\n But now this sentence has rarely been mentioned again, because people find that opportunities are often hidden in the latter.\n When the epidemic brought the global auto industry into a dark moment, shrinking manpower and reducing expenditure to cut projects has become a self-protection measure that many car companies have to make.\n However, there are exceptions.\n Gao Le, President and CEO of BMW Group Greater China, said in an interview with Tencent Motors that the previously announced projects in China will not only land as planned, but also increase investment in the future.\n The more severe the situation, the stronger we must have confidence in China. He said.\n With regard to BMW's style of behavior, Gao Le, who joined the company in 1999, naturally has a say.\n In his view, it is BMW's tradition to boldly take action and plan for the future when facing difficulties.\n One of the most typical examples is in 2008. In the year when the environmental protection concept was just beginning to penetrate the hearts of the people and coincided with the global financial crisis, BMW not only launched the MINI pure electric version under great pressure, but also released the world’s first three years later. New energy sub-brand BMW i.\n Looking back now, all in the industry praise BMW's advanced strategic vision and execution.\n Similarly, the first generation of X5, which came out in 1999, created a unique segment of the SAV luxury sports utility vehicle with great success.\n Automobile is a long-term business. Whether we invest in factories or models, we will focus on the future, and will not harm the long-term development of the future in order to control costs in the short term. Gao Le said.\n It is understood that the second phase of the BMW Brilliance High-Voltage Power Battery Center in Shenyang and the construction of the new Tiexi plant are continuing to progress as planned and have not been affected by the epidemic.\n Obviously, as BMW's largest market in the world, China's localization process is crucial.\n Gao Le emphasized that BMW has always adhered to the principle that production follows the market, so it will continue to promote localization work, and the supply chain will also follow the production of the entire vehicle accordingly.\n Although BMW has announced the closure of its factories in Europe, South Africa and the United States, due to the fact that most vehicles imported into China are transported by unaffected freighters, the supply of hot-selling models including X5 and X7 is still sufficient in the short term.\n The long-term impact depends on the timing of the external market shutdown. If most factories can resume production on April 19, the impact on China is currently controllable. Gaulle added.\n During the epidemic, BMW is also constantly strengthening the types and frequency of online activities.\n Regardless of market budget investment or work intensity, BMW's online marketing in China currently accounts for a relatively high proportion, and this is driven by customers' consumer behavior.\n Gao Le said that as all walks of life are gradually returning to good development, this shows the resilience and vitality of the Chinese economy, and also makes BMW pay more attention to China. The more severe the market situation, the more BMW will strengthen its confidence in China.\n BMW summarized the fight against the epidemic into two major stages.\n From the outbreak of the epidemic to the beginning of March is the first stage. In the words of insiders, this period is called epidemic control. BMW's main job is to take good care of employees, support social anti-epidemic and fight side by side with partners.\n And now in the second phase of getting back on track, the main job is to do a good job of resuming production and regaining confidence while reinvigorating the business.\n It is understood that during the epidemic, BMW held several online conferences with dealers and investors. Members of the management team not only introduced support policies to dealers in person, but also conducted online Q&A. The response was very good.\n In fact, before February 17, a lot of BMW's operations have been transferred online. Gao Le lamented that such a degree of digitization is unprecedented, but at the same time the results are also satisfactory.\n The latest data shows that as of the end of March, the recovery rate of BMW dealers has reached 95%, and since the middle of March, BMW's terminal business recovery has also been very good.\n As the business picks up, for BMW, the highlight of this year is undoubtedly the BMW iX3, which will be officially released in the fourth quarter. It is also the first brand-new model that truly responds to the choice of power.\n At the recent financial report annual meeting, BMW Group Chairman Zipzer proposed this concept. In his view, the global market is different, and customer needs are also very different, so it is necessary to use flexible architecture to produce models with different drive systems to meet the different needs of consumers.\n Therefore, there will be two versions of the BMW iX3 in production in China: one is the gasoline version of the BMW X3, the other is the pure electric version of the BMW iX3, and other markets will provide diesel and plug-in hybrid versions.\n Talking about the impact of the epidemic on the luxury car market, Gao Le believes that whether it is a first-time car buyer or a replacement upgrade, their demand is still strong.\n When we look at the local markets at different levels, we find that the proportion of luxury cars in first-tier and second-tier cities is already quite high, but the proportion of luxury cars in third-, fourth-, and fifth-tier cities is still relatively low, so the potential is great.\n He emphasized that BMW's next step in the prevention and control of the epidemic will not be slack, and its long-term China strategy will not be shaken.\n Crisis moment is the best touchstone, confidence is more valuable than gold, BMW will set an example with its own further actions. Gao Le said"

The company said it will be able to produce 1.5 million masks every month after the company achieved full-load production at the Warren transmission plant it closed last year.\n On March 27, US President Donald Trump accused General Motors of wasting time in producing ventilators in cooperation with Ventec Life Systems, and General Motors denied the President's accusations. Trump later cited the Defense Production Act to pressure General Motors to immediately begin producing ventilators, and General Motors later confirmed plans to produce 10,000 ventilators at its Kokomo, Indiana plant.\n On March 20, General Motors began manufacturing masks, and a week later, the team responsible for this work produced the first batch of samples on a new production line. More than 30 General Motors engineers, designers, purchasers, and production team members are assisting in product development, sourcing materials and equipment, and planning production processes. The raw materials used for the masks, including metal nose clips, elastic bands and non-woven filter materials, all come from GM's existing supply chain. GM also cooperates with JR Automation in the Netherlands and Esys Automation in Auburn Hills to design and manufacture Machine equipment used for mask assembly.\n At 2:30 pm local time on March 27, local time, the first mask produced by GM went offline. As of March 30, the factory produced more than 2,000 test masks. These masks are used to conduct quality inspections before officially starting production. Peter Thom, GM's vice president of global production, said: The team not only achieved its goals, but also exceeded its tasks. We are excited because it means that we are one step closer to protecting the medical team that is saving lives.\n After starting full-speed production, the line will be able to produce up to 50,000 masks per day.

    "content": "6月5日的《科学》杂志上，发表了一篇评论性文章，认为雄性激素可能助力新冠病毒对细胞的入侵。注意，这是一篇新闻评论性文章，并不是研究论文，文章作者是 Meredith Wadman，归入杂志的新闻栏目。有人据此认为男性更容易感染新冠病毒，并猜测是否可以用抗雄激素治疗来预防和治疗新冠病毒。\n 新冠病毒重男轻女的问题，其实很早就被大家注意到了。1月24日，《柳叶刀》杂志上发表了第一份关于新冠患者的流行病学报告，研究对象是武汉最早入院的41例患者，其中有30例为男性，占比73% 。\n 第二份新冠患者的流行病学报告，发表于《柳叶刀》杂志，研究对象是99名入住金银潭医院的新冠肺炎患者，男性比例同样很高，为68% 。\n 从这两份数据看，感觉好像男性更容易感染新冠病毒。但是《科学》上的新闻报道，并没有举上面这两个数据。这是为什么呢？\n 因为，在上述两份报告之后，《新英格兰医学杂志》发表过一份对更多新冠患者调查的流行病学报告，研究对象是425个武汉患者。这份报告按照发病时间把患者进行分组，结果发现在1月1日之前，感染的患者中66%是男性；在1月1日至11日，患者男性比例为59%；在1月12日之后，男性比例继续降低到48%。\n 与此同时，在以上报告中的3个时间段里，研究对象中与华南海鲜批发市场有关的病例也逐渐减少，比例从最初的66%，先降到16%，最后在1月12日之后更是降到了6%。这份研究结果表明，\n 这些数据也清楚地表明了流行病学研究的一个弊病：虽然能够观察到一个现象，但因为造成该现象的原因可能有很多，对于数据的解释一定要谨慎，过度的解读会导致完全歪曲的结论。\n 《科学》上发表的新闻评论文章，举的不是武汉的例子，而是意大利和美国纽约的例子。在意大利的伦巴第地区，从2月20日至3月18日期间收治于重症监护（ICU）的1591名新冠患者，有82%是男性。在美国纽约，对5700名入院治疗的新冠患者的调查结果显示，男性死亡率超过了女性。\n 注意到这些也同样是流行病学调查的数据，同样需要谨慎解读，但是因为在不同的地区都看到类似的现象，\n 但是，即便男性感染后症状确实会比较严重，对于一般的吃瓜群众来说，这个研究结果并不见得有任何意义。一方面，女性不能因此就不惧病毒，放弃应该进行的防护，因为女性一旦感染病毒，虽然出现严重情况的可能性会低一点，但是不能保证就肯定不会出现严重后果。而且，女性感染后，还是会把病毒传给周围的男性，导致病毒继续扩散。在另一方面，男性也不能因此过于恐惧，如果所在地区已经长时间没有出现新确诊病例，大家都不需要戴口罩了，男性也不用继续小心翼翼地躲在家里，担心一出门就撞上病毒。\n 男性和女性的区别，是男性的雄性激素更高。能把雄性激素与新冠病毒感染联系起来的，是一个叫做TMPRSS2的蛋白。雄性激素与其受体结合后，前列腺就会产生TMPRSS2，而在新冠病毒的感染过程中，TMPRSS2可以切割病毒表面的刺突蛋白（S蛋白），相当于是把S蛋白打磨得更锋利，更容易穿透进入细胞。\n 但是，这也只是一个完美的理论，并不能解释所有的现象。如果雄性激素真能促进病毒感染，导致病情更严重，那雄性激素普遍较高的年轻男性，为什么没有出现更高的感染率和死亡率呢？恰恰相反，还是老年男性比年轻男性更容易出现严重的后果。\n 《科学》杂志的评论提到，支持雄性激素在病毒感染中起作用的一个证据，来自意大利对42000名前列腺癌患者的分析，发现接受抗雄激素治疗（ADT）的患者，感染新冠的可能性只有其他患者的四分之一。ADT患者的住院和死亡概率也更低。\n 需要再次指出，这份研究同样是流行病学调查的研究，也同样需要谨慎解读。比如说一次大风吹倒了好多树，但是一棵有鸟巢的树没有倒，这是否可以推论出鸟巢让树更牢固了呢？\n 显然，这样的推论是荒谬的！还不如假设鸟有识别病树的能力，会挑选比较牢固的树筑巢。\n 在上述前列腺癌患者的例子中，同样有这样一种可能性：接受抗雄激素治疗的患者，因为病情比较严重，所以比较小心，没有出去浪，所以被病毒感染的机会减少；相反，因为前列腺癌比较良性，大部分早期的患者在手术之后，就能获得治愈，如果不需要治疗，也没有注意必要的防护和社交疏远，任性参加打牌等社交活动，反而就可能更容易感染病毒。\n 当然，因为各种可能性都有，也并不能因此就完全否定抗雄激素治疗可能会带来的好处。到底抗雄激素治疗能否减少病毒感染、缓解患者症状呢？这必须要通过严格的临床试验来回答。\n 需要明确指出的是，抗雄激素治疗也是有副作用的，在没有严格的临床证据之前，万万不可就任性用来预防、治疗新冠。\n 总之，这些研究需要从专业的方面谨慎解读，如果能从中找到新冠感染的治疗办法，当然是极好的，但如果因此对雄性激素产生恐惧，甚至草率做出欲抗新冠，必先自宫的结论，那就太荒谬了。\n 想了解更多内容？微信搜"

    "content": "昨天全国新增本土病例39例（北京36例，河北3例），也就是说，6月11日至14日，4天时间里，北京新增79例新冠确诊患者。\n 而北京目前已公布的新增病例，都有新发地农贸市场的直接或间接接触史，这意味着环境到人的传播渠道非常明确。\n 6月15日凌晨，国家卫健委高级别专家组成员、中国疾控中心流行病学前首席科学家曾光对八点健闻说，现在已经不是环境传人的问题，疫情早已进展到人传人阶段，现阶段从环境到人的传播渠道已经切断，防控重点应转向按照疫情的人传人阶段控制疫情。\n 突然严峻的疫情形势，不仅让首都进入非常时期，也牵动着全国各地的神经。\n 6月13日至14日，国内多地发出提醒：如非必要，近期不要前往北京。还有一些省市要求，来自北京市中高风险地区（街道或乡镇）的人员，须接受14天隔离观察，各地松紧程度不一，也有的地区尺度严格，防控范围扩大到来自北京全市的人。\n 曾光认为，现阶段控制疫情需要进行精准防控，在控制疫情为第一要务的同时，注重复产复工的需要，而不是一刀切地进行扩大式防控。\n △ 2020年6月14日，丰台一家医院门口，等候核酸检测的人排起长队（吴靖摄）\n 虽然北京已确诊的79名新冠患者，绝大部分有新发地市场暴露史，证明是环境传人。但也有并无新发地市场暴露史的密切接触者被确诊，这意味着疫情已进入人传人阶段。\n 6月13日，沈阳新增2例新型冠状病毒肺炎确诊病例王某某、郎某某均为6月12日北京市确诊病例刘某某的关联病例。三人均为北京市中国肉类食品综合研究中心员工，其中刘某某是6月12日的北京市确诊病例，在流行病学调查中，他曾于6月5日到北京新发地菜市场进行过采样。在沈阳出差并确诊的王某某和郎某某，作为确诊病例刘某某的密切接触者，被沈阳疾控中心送去检查，确诊新冠阳性。\n 这个传播途径，意味着人传人的社区传播已产生。\n 曾光认为，现阶段北京疫情依然存在着三个未解之谜：一是此次新冠病毒的起源问题；二是此次北京疫情的爆发究竟从何时开始？三是，现阶段北京疫情传播到何种范围？他认为，第三个问题，是当下最重要的问题。\n 虽然多位专家认为，此次北京疫情可能是输入性病例，经由冷链传播进来，但是曾光认为现阶段的防控重点在于防控人传人。\n 新发地环境采样的基因溯源结果，已不具备第一位的重要性，它是一个学术问题；当下需要了解疫情人传人扩散的范围，把注意力高度集中于防控人传人。曾光强调。\n 武汉新冠疫情给人最大的教训是，当疫情进展到人传人阶段，全部精力还用在防控环境（华南海鲜市场）传人上。曾光补充道。\n 在今年二、三月份新冠疫情爆发的高峰期，各地疫情的防控措施是最高级别，大部分城市将从外地来的人群都实行为期14天的集中隔离或居家隔离。对于疫情最严重的武汉，采取封城、阻断交通等措施。\n 现阶段，已不是此前疫情最严重的阶段，复产复工也是要考虑的问题，需要更精准的防控。曾光强调道。\n 他认为，此次北京市的防控反应迅速、及时，而且防控措施已下沉至社区，已具备精准防控的条件。\n 4月中旬，北京朝阳区一家4口确诊就成了高风险，而当时确诊病例更多的广州越秀区、黑龙江绥芬河市和哈尔滨道外区等地方却是中风险，引起较大的关注。\n 4月29日，中国卫生经济学会微信公号发布该会总顾问、原卫生部长高强的文章，建议对区域疫情风险标准进行修订。\n 之前的评估标准包含累计病例和14天内的聚集性病例，高强认为累计确诊病例数量主要反映疫情发展的历史过程，不能反映疫情的现实威胁，不宜再作为确定区域疫情风险级别的标准。对于出现新增确诊病例，包括聚集性病例，也不能简单地按病例数量来确定风险级别，还要全面评估流调和追踪能力，看传染源和传播渠道是否明确、密切接触者是否被全面掌控并接受医学观察。\n 4月30日，中央应对新冠肺炎疫情工作领导小组召开会议，提出要根据常态化防控要求，优化分区分级风险等级和响应级别标准，各地要依据本地疫情变化精准确定相应等级和级别，依法依规、科学划定防控区域范围至楼栋、病区、居民小区、自然村组等最小单元。\n 目前北京疫情风险等级分区已经细化到街乡镇。6月14日，北京新发地市场所处的丰台区花乡地区疫情风险等级目前已升级为高风险地区，是目前北京第一个疫情高风险地区。此外，北京市西城区金融街、月坛街道，丰台区太平桥街道、卢沟桥街道、新村街道、大兴区高米店街道、西红门镇、林校路街道均升级为中风险地区。\n 曾光认为，其它城市的防控，也不应该一刀切的对北京来的人进行14天隔离，而应该按照北京划分的不同的风险等级进行针对性的防控。\n 北京新疫情牵动着全国各地的神经，各地措施松紧程度不一。\n 6月13日，沈阳桃仙国际机场疫情防控指挥部发布通知，根据辽宁省疫情管控最新措施，从当晚8时起，对从北京市丰台区，西城区月坛街道，房山区长阳镇来辽人员采取14天集中隔离管控措施。\n 与此相关的是，辽宁省6月13日新增2例新冠确诊病例，经流行病学调查，2人均为北京市6月12日确诊病例的密切接触者。据沈阳市通报，此2人于6月11日乘坐高铁从北京南站出发，到沈阳出差。沈阳市疾控中心6月12日接到北京市疾控中心横传信息后，经核酸检测、辅助检查和进一步专家组会诊，确认2人为新冠确诊病例。\n 还有其他一些省市，虽暂未发现与北京当前疫情相关的确诊病例，但也反应迅速，针对来自北京中高风险地区人员，出台了管控措施。\n 6月13日，内蒙古通辽市发布通告：6月13日零时后，所有从北京市西城区、丰台区、房山区等疫情风险等级为中、高风险地区进入该市的人员，须向所在派出所、社区（嘎查村）主动申报个人健康情况，并一律实施14天集中隔离医学观察+2次核酸检测+1次血清抗体检测的管控措施。6月13日零时前，从上述中、高风险地区进入该市人员未满14天的，一律执行居家隔离医学观察至期满14天。\n 根据通告，今后国内疫情风险等级由低风险调整为中、高风险地区进入该市人员，均要严格按此规定执行。\n 同日，山东聊城也发布紧急通知，加强北京来聊人员管理。对于有丰台区旅居史的一律集中隔离至离京后14天，再居家隔离至离京后21天；对于有北京市（除丰台区外）旅居史的居家隔离至离京后14天，不具备居家隔离条件的，安排集中隔离。隔离到期后，核酸检测阴性且无症状者可解除隔离。\n 山西晋城市当日也发布通知，要求从即日起对北京市西城区、丰台区入晋人员在进入晋城第一时间做核酸检测，24小时出结果，最晚不超过48小时。检测结果为阴性的仍需继续隔离满14天，隔离期满核酸检测结果为阴性方可解除隔离。\n 6月14日，安徽省发出通知，对近期特别是5月30日以来到过北京新发地批发市场、京深海鲜市场等人员进行全面排查，发现有关人员立即安排隔离观察并进行核酸检测。\n 同日，四川省也发出通知，即日起，来自北京市高风险地区（街道或乡镇）的入（返）川人员均须实行14天集中隔离医学观察，来自北京市中风险地区（街道或乡镇）的入（返）川人员均须实行14天居家医学观察。\n 6月14日，一则从北京出发自驾去新疆却被要求劝返的消息在网络上流传。据红星新闻报道，新疆维吾尔自治区哈密市市长热线的工作人员表示，如果近期有旅客来自北京市，在抵达哈密后需要进行7天的隔离观察和7天的健康监测，并进行一次核酸检测。\n 据媒体梳理，目前不同地区对来自北京的旅客管控措施松紧不一。有的需隔离观察并接受核酸检测，有的仅需出示绿色健康码。有的仅针对来自北京中高风险地区的旅客，有的则尺度更为严格。\n △来自微信公众号：中国卫生杂志\n 另外，多地发出公告，近期不要前往北京。\n 据媒体梳理，6月13日和14日，河北迁安和定州、内蒙古通辽、天津滨海新区和蓟州区、辽宁省、江苏苏州、黑龙江大庆及哈尔滨等地疾控中心接连发出提醒和排查公告：如非必要，市民近期不要前往北京市。\n 6月13日，辽宁省大连市疾控中心发出紧急提醒：市民如非必要，近期不要前往北京市。如必须前往，请务必做好个人防护；从北京市返回大连后，要按照该市相关防控措施执行。\n 大连市同时要求，现居住该市，且与北京市确诊病例行程轨迹有交集，特别是5月30日以来到过北京新发地批发市场、京深海鲜市场，或接触过上述两个市场相关人员的市民，主动拨打各级疾控中心咨询热线，主动报备相关情况，并按相关防控措施执行。\n 此外，江西南昌和山西阳泉、吕梁、临汾、晋城等市也发布了类似通知。\n 刘冉 吴靖|撰稿\n 王吉陆|责"

Hidden dangers. At present, the distribution units that have purchased salmon from the epidemic-risk areas in our city have removed the shelves and stopped selling them.\n It is understood that from June 13th, the city's market supervision department has conducted a survey on the sales of frozen salmon and other aquatic products in the city's wholesale markets, farmers' markets, shopping malls, supermarkets, fresh supermarkets, and aquatic product wholesale (zero) businesses, focusing on Investigate the supply channels, merchant information, procurement methods, procurement quantity, etc., urge and guide the sellers of edible agricultural products to strictly implement the purchase inspection and other requirements, and request for certificates of origin or purchase certificates, qualification certificates and other relevant certificates according to law, without purchasing or storing 2. Sales of edible agricultural products that do not meet food safety standards, such as non-traceable certificates, unknown sources, and expired and spoiled products, especially for imported products, require the inspection and quarantine certification documents issued by the entry-exit inspection and quarantine department.\n As of 15 o'clock on the 14th, the city's market supervision department has touched 128 aquatic product sales businesses such as chilled salmon. Among them, 4 supermarkets and 3 markets have purchased salmon from epidemic-risk areas.

Can the virus survive on vegetables, fruits and meat?\n If the virus spreads to vegetables, meat and fruits through droplets and direct contact, it can theoretically survive for a certain period of time, but the longest will not exceed 48 hours.\n Viruses are different from bacteria. Bacteria can quickly reproduce and reproduce on dead cells. Viruses can only reproduce and replicate with the help of active cells, such as human and animal cells. Supermarket vegetables, meat, and fruits do not have the relevant conditions, so they survive. It won't be too long.\n 2. How do we sterilize after we buy back the ingredients?\n Some people say that it is safer to store food for a few more days. In fact, if the fresh vegetables and fruits are left for too long, they may deteriorate and breed a lot of bacteria. After eating, they will be bad for your health.\n Food is washed with running water before eating. It can filter out 80% or 90% of the virus attached to the surface. Remember not to eat raw food, but to cook it cooked. The fruit is best peeled. The virus is within 30 minutes at a temperature of 56℃ Can be killed, while cooking and other temperatures can reach 100 ℃ or higher, the virus can be killed immediately.\n In addition, the virus can be spread through droplets and direct contact, and may also be spread through the digestive system, so pay special attention to eating cold dishes and other raw foods.\n 3. How to use the cutting board at home to be safe? The chopping board and knives must be separated from raw and cooked, and often cleaned with baking soda, salt, vinegar, etc. Once the chopping board is moldy, it should not be used any more. The chopping board with too many knife marks is easy to hide dirt and dirt and should be replaced in time. Peninsula Morning News, 39-degree video reporter Qi Fang"

    "content": "6月14日零时到24时，北京市新增新冠肺炎确诊病例36例，这意味着自6月11日来，北京市累计新增确诊病例已达79例。36例新增病例中，包括海淀区玉泉东市场出现的3例。在此之前，海淀区卫健委曾于6月13日通报，玉泉东市场检出1例核酸病毒阳性患者，为无症状感染者。\n 据北京日报客户端报道，今天，中国疾控中心主任高福主持召开会议时强调，要采取坚决果断措施，遏制北京聚集性疫情扩散蔓延。目前，中国疾控中心已完成相关病例样本病毒全基因组序列测定和分析，初步结论已上报并正在积极开展病毒溯源。\n 报道称，为支持北京市疫情防控技术需要，6月12日，中国疾控中心迅速新增启动病毒病所南区P3实验室，扩大检测能力，提高检测效率，24小时不间断开展核酸检测工作，已完成样本检测1000余份。\n 在15日下午举行的北京市新冠疫情防控工作第118场新闻发布会上，北京市人民政府新闻发言人徐和建说，疫情发生后，北京市迅速对新发地批发市场进行封场休市，对其周边社区实行了封闭管理。今天我们又对玉泉东市场及周边社区实施了封闭管理，属地已经启动疫情防控战时机制。\n 流行病学专家、复旦大学公共卫生学院原院长姜庆五对《中国新闻周刊》分析称，\n 全市要对类似的农贸市场展开调查\n 北京市疾控中心副主任庞星火在今天的发布会上介绍说，全市新增36例病例中，男性25例，女性11例；北京户籍2例，外省户籍34例；丰台区23例、大兴区7例、海淀区2例，东城区、朝阳区、石景山区、房山区各有1例，已完成流行病学调查的34例均与新发地市场有关，还有2例正在流调中。\n 记者梳理自6月11日以来的新增病例发现，迄今为止，北京已经有8个区报告了确诊患者。\n 值得注意的是，这些新增病例中，有3例来自该区玉泉东市场。针对此形势，海淀区委常委、常务副区长李俊杰在今天上午的发布会上表示，海淀区目前已关停市场，立即展开病例流调溯源、人员排查等工作，对市场周边10个社区实施封闭管理，落实24小时专人值守。\n 《中国新闻周刊》记者现场观察发现，玉泉东市场长约330米，由一排夹在两侧居民楼之间的平房组成，面积约1000平方米，仅略大于普通的便民菜市场。从市场南门到附近的十一学校、五一小学、解放军总后勤部五一幼儿园、海淀区太平路小学（采石路校区）等多所学校的距离均不足500米。\n 针对玉泉东市场近日来出现的多例确诊病例，姜庆五分析说，接下来要关注玉泉东市场周边及其所在地区是否出现社区病人，这决定了该市场周边及北京市未来的疫情防控态势，如果病毒的传播仅仅局限在市场内，风险相对小一些。\n 北京大学第一医院呼吸和危重症医学科主任王广发持同样的观点。在他看来，要聚焦玉泉东市场确诊病例的流调，并进一步分析是否出现了二代、三代病例的传播。他还建议，除了新发地市场，全市要对类似的农贸市场展开调查，避免下一个新发地市场疫情的出现。\n 另据@西城健康发布的最新消息，6月14日，西城区广外天陶红莲菜市场有一名往来新发地市场的人员被确诊为新冠肺炎病例，其住在丰台区花乡。西城区有关部门已于当日上午暂停广外天陶红莲菜市场对外服务，并进行环境监测评估和相关人员隔离观察。\n 对于北京是否将对公共卫生事件响应级别进行调整，庞星火对《中国新闻周刊》回应称，北京市政府将根据疫情发展的态势进行评估而定。\n 新发地经营者乐园成重灾区\n 在目前北京市的79例确诊病例中，有24例来自丰台区花乡的新发地经营者乐园小区，在总确诊人数中占比为30%，该小区已成为北京此轮疫情的重灾区。\n 新发地市场周边共有11个小区，在市场外围的自南向北，依次分布着经营者乐园、天伦锦绣、银地家园、宜兰园等社区，这些小区均出现过确诊病例，但最集中的还是在经营者乐园。\n 《中国新闻周刊》6月14日下午来到新发地批发市场附近，发现整个市场已被封锁。目前，丰台区已经对上述11个小区实施了封闭管理，24小时专人值守。\n 新发地市场所在的新发地村本名新坟地，1958年填平坟地辟为农田，并逐渐形成新的聚落，改称新发地。1988年5月16日，以现北京新发地批发市场董事长张玉玺为首的15名村民在新发地村用铁丝网圈地15亩，利用15万元资金（区、乡、村各出资5万）成立了新发地农副产品批发中心。目前该市场占地面积已发展至1680亩，2019年交易量1749万吨，是北京市乃至亚洲交易规模最大的农产品批发市场，承担了北京市90%的农产品供应，有首都菜篮子之称。\n 经营者乐园小区是新发地市场为了让商户持续保障首都供应而专门建设的社区。据媒体报道，在其他城市，农产品批发商一般自行就近租房，而新发地市场因为是村集体企业，有土地的支配使用权，所以才能在寸土寸金的北京有这么大手笔。\n 据《北京日报》2017年报道，2000年以前，许多新发地商户在市场周边租房子，居住环境不佳。鉴于此，新发地在2001年至2010年间陆续建设了4个社区，命名为新发地经营者乐园，共提供1200多套、近10万平方米的房屋供商户租住。经营者乐园共有18栋楼，总房屋套数为459套。据公开信息，新发地市场固定摊位5526个，经营者乐园主要面向固定摊位商户，可入住5000多人。\n 从流行病学调查信息来看，居住在经营者乐园小区的确诊患者只有一位是北京丰台人，其余都是外地人员，其中大多数来自河北。在6月14日新增的11例该小区新冠病毒感染者中，有9例为河北人。\n 6月9日，新发地市场召开了2019年度表彰大会，董事长张玉玺把疫情防控成果总结为阶段性胜利。但这一胜利仅仅持续了3天"

He mentioned the measures taken by Ford last week, including postponing executive pay, postponing salary increases and cutting overtime.\n He said: I try to keep everything as it is, but as time goes on, I will have to make more changes. The idea of ​​this vacation is probably the best. Using vacation is a wise way, you can reduce some compensation for employees.\n This is painful, but there is no problem with the employees' jobs. When we have overcome the difficulties, we will repay the wages in place, and that will be the next thing we do.\n GM and Fiat Chrysler have stated that they will postpone the payment of 20% of the salaries of salaried employees, and that companies will later repay salaries that employees have underpaid.\n In addition, GM said that 6,500 American employees will start on vacation, and they can get 75% of their normal salary during the shutdown. Most of these employees work in engineering and manufacturing departments and cannot perform remote work.\n Hackett also said that Ford will not require employees to start work with a reduced salary. The company may adopt an arrangement in which employees first work for three weeks, then take a leave of absence for a week, and work in this way for several months.\n He said: In order to get the company back up and running, this is a painful decision, and we need our employees to put in the work. He also revealed that if the epidemic continues until early May, Ford may begin to take vacations.\n He said: When we feel threatened to resume work quickly, we will choose to stop working and take a holiday.\n Earlier Tuesday, Ford said it would postpone the reopening of its North American plant indefinitely. The company said last week that it planned to resume production at some North American plants in mid-April. So far, three UAW Ford employees known to have been infected with the new coronavirus have died.\n Hackett told reporters that he hopes to avoid reopening the plant prematurely and hopes to resume production after April.\n He said: My instinct tells me that the resumption time will be in May. We anticipate that there will be no specific resumption date before President Trump actually realizes ‘I want to start the economy before a certain date’.

He told the \"European Automotive News\" reporter: This approach is more suitable for the market.\n According to a report from the Auto Retail Agenda last month, the UK is Ford’s largest market in Europe, with as many as 180 of its 400 dealers facing the risk of closure.\n Raleigh pointed out to reporters that reducing the number of dealers will increase Ford's profitability. He said: Obviously, there are a lot of costs hidden in the distribution network. These costs will eventually be reflected in the price of the car, or offset part of the profit. We hope to improve the efficiency of the distribution network.\n He also believes that the reduction in the number of dealers will benefit Ford's (surviving) retailers.

He said: The deployment rules of the dealer network are still based on the principle of being reachable within 30 minutes by car, but the customer's willingness to drive has increased.\n Ford said that after reducing the number of dealers, 90% of Britons can still drive to their dealers within 30 minutes.\n Raleigh said that as part of the European automotive network reform, Ford is considering turning some dealers into service-only centers.

In this fight, one of the World Health Organization’s most powerful tools is the so-called social isolation, which has been used globally.\n In the United States, this means that people should avoid gathering 10 or more people, avoid traveling at will, and consider canceling all social visits in the family. The latest federal epidemic prevention guidelines in the United States have made it clear that the relevant isolation measures have been extended to April 30.\n In this regard, many companies, including some car manufacturers, are very supportive of social isolation measures against the epidemic. Volkswagen and Audi released a video promoting the measure earlier this month and revised their respective logos. Mercedes-Benz has now joined similar initiatives.\n It is reported that, like the other two German brands, Mercedes has added some space between its famous three-pointed star and the ring surrounding it. Since the new logo was released about 18 hours ago, the logo has attracted the attention of not less than 140,000 netizens on Facebook and received nearly 3,000 user reviews.\n Deborah Burkes, coordinator of the new coronavirus outbreak response of the US government, said on NBC's \"Today Show\": If we do things well (quarantine measures), we may have 100,000 to 200,000 deaths .\n We don’t even want to see this happen.

The company also invited the popular band OneRepublic to record a song during the quarantine last week to create momentum for the event.\n This event will be supported by television and digital media. Starting this Wednesday (April 1st, local time), the automaker will use Drive Forward instead of a separate advertising form to promote its car brands, including Jeep, Chrysler, Dodge and Ram.\n It is worth mentioning that before the FCA decided to stop regular advertising, other car manufacturers have already taken similar actions. Car companies are beginning to face up to the reality that during the pandemic of a new coronavirus, advertising for new car launches or general sales activities will usually not work.\n Most new advertisements promote financial bailout plans, such as deferred payments, because automakers try to keep consumers interested. But in fact, most people are concerned about more urgent needs, such as hoarding groceries. However, despite these new subsidies, it is difficult for automakers to overcome the difficulty that car purchases may continue to slow significantly.\n Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said in a report on March 27: At present, US car sales are basically frozen. Investors have fully accepted the reality that the US auto industry may shut down for one to two months, and we are now asked to envision a scenario where the auto industry shuts down for 6 or 9 months.\n On Wednesday, FCA released data showing that sales fell by 10% in the first quarter. It is worth mentioning that the company's strong sales momentum in January and February was completely offset by the negative economic impact of the new coronavirus in March.\n The battery advertisement launched by FCA comes from Michigan advertising company Doner. In the advertisement, FCA promotes its 84-month zero-interest-rate financial car purchase program and home car selection and car purchase services provided to consumers. The latter can allow consumers to complete the entire car purchase process online.\n The FCA said in a statement: Consumers can not only buy cars without dealers, but also make car discounts, apply for loans, obtain price and payment estimates, and evaluate options for after-sales service protection plans. Vehicle delivery services are handled by individual dealers, who have expanded their service scope after the epidemic.\n According to Variety, OneRepublic recorded the song \"Better Days\" at the end of the band's fifth album.\n In a statement about the Better Days event, FCA Chief Marketing Officer Olivier Francois said: We want to provide support and financial help to consumers, and at the same time, we all work together to better Life is moving forward.

Another blow to the Mexican economy.\n Aguascalientes is one of the 12 states in Mexico that have car factories. The state’s Minister of Economic Development Manuel Gonzalez said in an interview with reporters that some manufacturers have told him that their zero Parts are about to be depleted.\n The minister told a Reuters reporter: I have been in contact with some important companies. They told me that their inventory is only enough to support the second or third week of March, but if the supply cannot return to normal, we may Seeing the suspension of production by the company.\n The rapid spread of the new coronavirus epidemic has spread to the global economy and has had a disruptive impact on the supply chain. According to Reuters statistics, more than 119,100 people worldwide have been infected with the new coronavirus, of which 4,298 people died, and the vast majority of deaths occurred in China.\n If Mexican automakers are forced to stop production, it will not be a good sign for Mexico’s President Lopez’s vision to lead his country (the second largest economy in Latin America) out of a mild recession.\n The automotive industry is the backbone of Mexico’s manufacturing industry, which accounts for nearly 3% of the country’s GDP. According to data released by the International Organization of Automobile Manufacturers, Mexico is the seventh-largest automobile producer in the world.\n It is worth mentioning that nearly 80% of Mexican-made cars are shipped to its largest trading partner, the United States.\n Aguascalientes is an automobile manufacturing center in central Mexico, where Nissan has two factories, Mercedes-Benz has a factory, and a joint venture formed by Daimler and Renault-Nissan is also located here.\n A Daimler spokesman said the company’s business in Aguascalientes is currently operating normally.\n Luciana Herrmann, director of public relations at Nissan Mexico, said in an interview with reporters that despite rising costs, Nissan has begun to use aircraft instead of shipping to avoid any regressions in production.

    "content": "According to NBC reports, when GM suffered a six-week strike last fall, its factories and dealers, as well as independent repair shops, quickly felt the impact: auto repair parts soon appeared in short supply. Now, the rapid spread of new coronavirus outbreaks may have the same effect.\n China is the first region where outbreaks occurred. Since late January, its auto industry has been almost completely closed, which has severely damaged the production and export of Chinese-made auto parts.\n According to data from the Automobile Research Center, China’s exports of auto parts to the United States last year were approximately US$17 billion (about 118.33 billion yuan). If the parts that pass through Mexico and Canada and then shipped to the United States are included, this number will be even higher.\n Automakers such as GM, Honda and Hyundai are working hard to maintain supply, and to a certain extent use air transportation to keep China's supply lines open. But according to Cara Belo, CEO of the Automobile Research Center, 60%-75% of Chinese auto parts will eventually enter the US aftermarket.\n According to official sources, most of China's auto factories are now back to work, but a report released this week by Asian auto consulting firm ZoZo Go estimates that only 20% to 30% of workers actually return to work. In other words, these factories can only operate at a speed much lower than the normal operating rate at best.\n In an interview with NBC News, Bello said: US auto production may be affected within one to one and a half months, and the parts and service sectors will feel this impact sooner. For car owners, this will depend on the brand of the car purchased and the degree of vehicle use.\n According to data from the US International Trade Commission, China is a major producer of replacement body parts. Last year, China’s exports of replacement body parts accounted for about 10% of its global auto parts exports, that is, about 14.2 billion US dollars (about 98.84 billion yuan), most of which were used for maintenance after car accidents.\n In addition, tires accounted for 5% of its global auto parts exports, last year was 7.9 billion US dollars (about 54.99 billion yuan). China’s export parts cover almost all products in the automotive field, from suspensions to windshields, wipers, etc. Car repair fans who like to find their own replacement parts in local auto parts stores will soon feel the impact.\n Stacey Miller, senior public relations director of the Auto Repair Association, said that even if China's business soon returns to normal, the United States will feel a supply shortage in mid-March. The association’s members predict that there will be a supply disruption throughout May or June. The Auto Repair Association is a trading group representing 150,000 auto parts and service companies across the United States.\n Cox Chief Analyst Michelle Krebs said that from a broader perspective, the new coronavirus outbreak seems to have little effect on US car sales in February. Like most industry analysts and planners, Cox had predicted that new car sales in the United States would decline slightly in 2020, from 17 million last year to about 16.6 million.\n Krebs said in an interview: This is the best situation at present. If the coronavirus epidemic worsens, new car sales may fall further to 16 million.\n Analysts warned that the more serious problem is that the epidemic may impact the US market in many different ways:\n If China is unable to control the situation, the shortage of parts will ultimately affect US automobile production, because almost all US assembly plants rely on at least some Chinese parts;\n Even parts from other trading partners may slow down, because these suppliers still rely on China to provide nuts, bolts and other basic parts;\n As in China, with the spread of the epidemic and the requirements of the quarantine directive, analysts worry that American car consumers may be reluctant to go out and buy vehicles at dealers;\n The stock market crash may trigger an economic collapse and further restrain U.S. sales.\n Bello finally pointed out that there are currently signs that some areas of the new car market may be slowing down, especially the bulk purchase business of car rental companies that have been hit hardest by the decline in the tourism industry.\n So far, the U.S. auto industry has not been greatly affected, but analysts agree that if the epidemic cannot be quickly controlled, the situation may turn sharply down"

    "content": "2019年，全球车市跌宕起伏，零部件企业境遇亦不甚乐观，钱袋子就可以说明一切。\n 据各大零部件企业近日发布的2019财报，显示尽管博世、法雷奥、佛吉亚等多家企业去年销售额跑赢大盘，部分甚至实现了逆势增长，但利润大幅缩水的亦不在少数，例如彼欧、伟世通、德纳、科思创等，去年跌幅都超过了40%。\n 2020开局，经济持续低迷，又有新冠肺炎肆虐，多重压力之下，零部件企业们又将何去何从？\n 近日，各大零部件企业纷纷发布了2019年财报数据，显示由于对新技术领域的不断加大、车市持续萎靡及通用罢工、汇率波动等的影响，在过去的一年很多主流零部件企业的市场表现相较于2018年均出现了不同程度的下滑，即使是全球汽车零部件供应商百强榜上排名相对靠前的企业亦不例外。\n ● 对新业务领域投入加大 致利润下滑\n 图片来源：麦格纳\n 例如\n 在2019麦格纳中国媒体日活动上，麦格纳就曾集中展示了其多项智能驾驶领域的先进技术，包括基于视觉技术的高级驾驶辅助系统、高分辨率汽车雷达ICON RADAR，域控制器和高度集成的自动驾驶开发平台，以及3D环视系统、ICON雷达、第四代前置摄像头模块等。据悉，根据客户不同需求，这些产品既可以模块化整体应用，也可以个性化单独订制。\n 其实加大对新技术领域的布局是目前几乎所有零部件企业都会做的一件事。例如大陆汽车集团去年在研发方面的总投入就高达29.0亿欧元，相较于2018年同期的27.6亿欧元，增长5.1%；在投资方面的总投入为20.6亿欧元，与2018年的20.2亿欧元相比，增长2.1%。可以说，只有为数不多的企业能够在这充满挑战的时代做到这一点。\n 图片来源：博世\n 博世则计划今年在电气化、自动化、互联化交通出行上投资超过10亿欧元，其中对包括燃料电池技术在内的电气化交通领域投资5亿欧元，对自动驾驶领域投资超过6亿欧元，并投资1亿欧元用于互联化交通解决方案。在2013年至2020年期间，博世在新业务领域的总投资将达到约30亿欧元。\n 另外，李尔去年也花费了大约10亿美元的资金来拓展新业务领域和提升运营效率，虽然这些业务暂时并不能帮助提升公司利润。\n ● 市场持续萎靡，车企需求减弱\n 当然，导致零部件企业营收下滑更主要的原因还在于去年车市持续低迷。据相关统计数据显示，2019年全球汽车整体销量（包括乘用车和商用车等）约为9032万辆，与2018年的9333万辆相比，微跌3.25%，连续第二年下降。其中美国、英国、日本、印度、中国等多个市场，新车销量均出现了下跌，特别是中国，去年销量跌幅高达8%，创下了20年来的最大跌幅。而中国又恰恰是很多跨国零部件巨头的重要战略市场，他们受到的波及可想而知。\n 图片来源：博世\n 据悉\n 图片来源：大陆集团\n 2019财年实现销售额265亿欧元，相较于2018财年的269 亿欧元，下降1.2%，虽然也跑赢了大盘，但经营性利润却为-21亿欧元，息税前利润率为-7.9%，出现了较大幅度的下滑。深入分析，由于汽车行业整体低迷，去年大陆汽车集团三大业务——底盘及安全事业群、车身电子事业群和动力总成事业群，均出现了一定的亏损，其中底盘安全息税前亏损1.2亿欧元，动力总成亏损6.6亿欧元，车身电子亏损13.3亿欧元。\n 2019全年，大陆集团总销售额达444.8亿欧元，与2018财年基本持平；调整后息税前利润率为7.4%，相当于调整后的经营性利润为32亿欧元。橡胶集团——包括轮胎事业群和康迪泰克事业群，是主要的贡献点。特别是轮胎业务，在市场环境萎缩的情况下，自然增长率只小幅下降了0.2%，还算稳定。\n 不过也有例外，比如\n 图片来源：佛吉亚\n 分析原因，去年佛吉亚完成对歌乐电子业务的收购，以及美元兑欧元的汇率浮动产生的正面影响，都对佛吉亚财务目标的达成起到了重要的助推作用。特别是对歌乐电子业务的收购，在去年为佛吉亚带来了19亿欧元的销售额。此外，佛吉亚几大主营业务——座椅、内饰和绿动智行系统，本身表现也十分出色。其中座椅系统，2019年销售额达69.73亿欧元，同比2018年下滑6.2%；内饰系统销售额达53.7亿欧元，与2018年基本持平；绿动智行系统销售额达46.54亿欧元，同比增长0.8%。\n ● 其他影响因素，如通用罢工、汇率波动等\n 除了以上两点，通用罢工和汇率波动也是导致部分企业去年营收缩水的重要原因。\n 例如\n 图片来源：李尔\n 2018年通用在李尔业务当中的占比达18%，堪称李尔最大的客户。2019年9月，通用汽车本土4.8万名员工因工资和劳动合同问题，举行了为期长达40天的全国大罢工，据李尔首席执行官 Ray Scott曾透露，此举每周导致李尔损失7000万至7500万美元，最终李尔的总损失约在5.25亿美元左右，为此李尔不得不调低2019全年的收入预期。另外，汇率的波动也导致了李尔以美元计价的销售额出现缩水。\n 麦格纳的车身外饰和结构业务，由于通用罢工，销售额也出现了2.25亿美元的下降。再加上北美和欧洲汽车产量的下降，以及欧元兑美元汇率走软等因素的影响，去年第四季度麦格纳旗下四个主要部门的营收都出现下滑，最终导致该公司去年第四季度营收下降7.3%至94亿美元。\n 图片来源：安波福\n 因通用罢工，去年蒙受了2亿美元的销售额损失和1.1亿美元的利润损失。且与李尔一样，由于汇率波动，安波福的财务指标也受到了不利影响——以美元计价的销售额和营业利润分别减少3%和4%左右。2019全年，安波福的营业收入同比微跌0.54%，达143.57亿美元；营业利润下跌13.4%，达12.76亿美元。\n 图片来源：伟世通\n 受福特延迟推出新车以及通用罢工的影响，第四季度销售额下降了1.8%至7.44亿美元，净收入大跌19%达3500万美元。2019年全年，由于汽车产量下降、不利的汇率以及客户定价的影响，伟世通净收入大跌57%至7000万美元，销售额也同比微跌1.3%至29.5亿美元。\n 由于通用罢工，第四季度营收减少8800万美元，利润减少2700万美元，最终营收仅实现41亿美元，同比下降3.2%；净亏损增加一倍以上，至2.93亿美元；调整后息税、折旧及摊销前利润同比下降23%至3.14亿美元。\n 不过，由于天纳克去年的财报涵盖了其于2018年收购的辉门的首个全年营收，这使其去年营收同比大涨48%至174.5亿美元；净亏损达3.14亿美元；调整后息税折旧摊销前利润则同比大涨36%至14亿美元。\n 图片来源：法雷奥\n 此外还有\n 进入2020年，受新冠肺炎疫情的影响，车市供需两弱，低迷依旧。据乘联会最新统计数据显示，\n 那么，值此严峻的时刻，今年各大零部件巨头对于市场又有怎样的预估和期待呢？\n 为此，博世正进一步考量内部成本结构，据悉在必要时博世也将采用尽可能合情合理的方式进行人员优化调整。博世将面临充满挑战的一年，我们力求增强盈利能力。博世集团首席财务官及董事会副主席Stefan Asenkerschbaumer表示，而维持高盈利对博世的业务转型和继续保持对未来核心技术的大量投资尤为重要。\n 图片来源：大陆集团\n 基于市场持续的不确定性，大陆集团预计2020年其销售额约为425至445亿欧元，调整后息税前利润率约为5.5%至6.5%。其中汽车技术子集团及之前的动力总成事业群销售总额约为255至265亿欧元，调整后息税前利润率约为3%至4%。橡胶技术子集团的销售额约为170至180亿欧元，调整后息税前利润率约为10%至11%。\n 基于此，李尔预计公司今年销售收入将在194~202亿美元之间，营业利润在12.1~13.4亿美元之间，整体经营情况基本与去年持平。\n 图片来源：佛吉亚\n 而\n 基于这一假设，佛吉亚2020全年财务目标是：继续实现稳健的报表销售额增长和持续强劲的现金增长，到2022年，实现销售额超过205亿欧元，营业利润率达到8%，净现金流达到销售额的4%。值得一提的是，这一目标尚未计入新型冠状病毒肺炎给全球供应链带来的潜在风险。\n 另外法雷奥、伟世通、科思创、海拉等也都一致认为2020年汽车市场环境仍然充满挑战，强劲、持续的复苏不太可能出现。对此，科思创首席财务官指出，在当前的市场环境中，只有通过更高效的运营、确定项目的轻重缓急、不断审视投资，才能保持所需的财务灵活性，最终取得成功。因此，科思创正加快实施一项旨在提升效能和效率的长期项目。该项目于2018年10月启动，已帮助科思创在上一财年削减约1.5亿欧元的成本，2020年科思创的目标通过该项目节省2.5亿欧元。此外，该公司还采取了各种短期措施，例如进行更有效率的成本管理，以及对所有现有和计划中的投资再次审查。\n 海拉则选择大力提高竞争力，并继续投资创新解决方案，以应对电气化和自动驾驶的市场趋势。在这一系列的措施下，海拉预计2019/2020财年（2019年6月1日——2020年6月1日）公司的汇率和资产组合调整后的销售额将会在约65亿-70亿欧元区间，受重组措施和资产组合影响，调整后的息税前利润率将会在6.5%到7.5%的区间内。\n 图片来源：森萨塔科技\n 森萨塔科技亦表示未来公司在保持盈利能力领先行业的同时，将持续投资有长期增长前景的项目，例如该公司应用于车队管理的智能互联项目，这代表着森萨塔科技未来的增量业务和崭新的潜在客户基础。对于2020年全年，森萨塔科技预计销售额将在33.99亿美元至34.99亿美元之间，调整后的净收入预计将在5.39亿美元至5.64亿美元之间，调整后的每股收益预计将在3.42美元至3.58美元之间。\n 由此可见，尽管2020年车市开局并不是很顺利，零部件巨头们对于各自今年的表现依旧十分乐观。然另一方面，目前国内新冠肺炎疫情虽然得到了很好的控制，但海外却仍在持续，并且已经蔓延至日本、韩国、意大利、伊朗等多个国家，这无疑给今年车市增添了更多的不确定因素，上述企业想要继续维持他们对于2020年业绩的预判，或许并不是一件容易的事"

Sex has become the focus of most concern at this stage.\n Recently, Valeo, a well-known supplier of auto parts, issued a statement saying that in view of the impact of the business in the European and North American factories in the last two weeks of March, and the inability to determine the end of the epidemic, Valeo announced that it had previously projected a financial target for 2020 Withdrawal, and at the same time adjust the production capacity of the regions where the group is located.\n According to the relevant person in charge of Valeo (China), affected by the closure of many car manufacturers and dealers, Valeo's factories in North America and Mexico have also been closed, and some factories are partially closed.\n In fact, not only Valeo, but many global parts giants have recently withdrawn their previously released fiscal year 2020 forecasts, all of which have indicated that they will significantly reduce non-essential investments and costs, and seek certain credit lines to ensure financial flexibility. .\n As another leader in the auto parts industry, An Bo Fu also implemented a series of measures to deal with the impact of the epidemic. To increase financial flexibility and liquidity, the company will use all of the remaining amount of its revolving line of credit, about 1.4 billion US dollars, and suspend the payment of about 225 million annual dividends. In addition, due to the closure of the customer's factory and changes in production plans, the corresponding factories have also reduced production. Anbo Fu said.\n It is worth mentioning that parts companies have adopted a contraction strategy on the one hand, and those who are still maintaining business on the other hand can only mitigate operating costs by raising prices. It is understood that many companies at different levels of the automotive supply chain, including vehicle manufacturers, Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers, raw material manufacturers, and other raw material manufacturers, have recently encountered price increases from suppliers, covering vehicle manufacturing, Interior and exterior decoration, chassis, powertrain, electric system, automotive electronics and other fields.\n Recently, the laser radar manufacturer Lei Shen Intelligent released a product price adjustment notice that the company’s costs in all aspects have increased sharply during the epidemic, and the product price has surged by 20% to 50%. Since April 1, the company’s entire range of laser radar The price of the product has been increased by 20%; in the tire field, more than a dozen tire manufacturers such as Michelin and Pirelli also announced that they will increase the price of some models of tires by 5% to 10%.\n According to the latest passenger federation data, domestic passenger car production in the narrow sense in March was 981,000, a year-on-year decrease of 51.2%, and a year-on-year increase of 370.3%; comprehensive passenger vehicle sales were 1.045 million, a year-on-year decrease of 40.4%, and a year-on-year increase of 317.5%. From the perspective of sales volume, the domestic auto market showed a good trend of bottom V-shaped rebound in March, reflecting the rapid recovery of consumption just after the epidemic. Cui Dongshu, secretary general of the China Federation of Trade Unions, told reporters from the Securities Daily.\n However, as parts companies have increased their prices due to the impact of the global epidemic, and the entire industry chain has been passed in turn, will autos adjust prices in a large scale and affect the development of the auto market?\n Yuan Mingxue, executive vice president of Changan Automobile, had previously expressed concerns about the stability of the supply chain in an interview. At present, we have cleared that there are more than 100 suppliers and more than 3,000 parts in the supply chain, all of which are produced and manufactured overseas, involving 23 countries and regions, most of which are in key epidemic areas, and the complexity and difficulty are far Far more than the domestic supply chain resumption of work.\n The \"Securities Daily\" reporter noticed that on April 11th, Sany Heavy Industry, a well-known domestic construction machinery company, issued a price adjustment notice, stating that production costs have risen sharply due to the inability of the overseas parts industry chain supporting parts manufacturers to guarantee supply. The price of excavators is increased by 10%, and the price of medium and large-sized excavators is increased by 5%. Although the professional market for excavators is narrow and the impact of price adjustment is not widespread, the problem of pressure on parts costs is also targeted at passenger car companies.\n In this regard, senior automotive analyst Lin Xi believes that the price increase of parts has become a trend, and vehicle companies must choose to digest this part of the rising cost, or can only be transmitted downward. As for the price adjustment through the replacement of suppliers, he believes that the rising price of the ship, coupled with the long verification period and high research and development requirements, is unlikely to be replaced.\n The price of the terminal depends on the recovery of the market. If, as some organizations have predicted, 20% of dealers will fall in the next few months, then in order to survive, lowering prices becomes a more realistic option. The car price may be further lowered in a short time. Lin said that the brand will have a certain bargaining power. Taken together, the short-term will not have much impact on sales and selling prices"

    "content": "受疫情影响，多家汽车工厂再次宣布停产。\n 据路透社报道，丰田汽车今日起暂停在俄罗斯的生产，这意味丰田旗下欧洲所有工厂都已经停产。此前丰田汽车已经宣布延长北美、巴西、马来西亚和泰国工厂的停产时间。不过丰田在官方声明中称，虽然生产设备关闭，但是维修保养、零配件仓库和车辆运输不会受到影响。\n 目前，包括欧、美、日、韩等整车制造业集中地合计已有超过100家汽车工厂处于停产状态，而工厂停产也给车企和各国汽车产业造成了较大的损失。以大众汽车集团为例，其在中国的工厂虽然已经复工，销售水平也恢复到疫情前50%的水平，但在全球其他国家的生产销售工作均处于停滞状态。大众集团CEO迪斯称，停产停工每周给大众造成20亿欧元的损失，平均每天约2.86亿欧元。\n 联合国贸易发展会议（UNDTAC）的研究数据则显示，受疫情影响，预计2月份欧盟域内成员国的汽车产业损失额达25亿美元。IHS Markit 一项新的研究预计在欧洲、北美和拉美车企工厂的关停可能使汽车产量减少140万。在欧洲，装配业务平均关闭13个工作日，将使汽车产量减少88万辆以上。据其估计，北美的停产将使生产平均损失6个工作日，减少48万辆汽车的产量。\n 值得注意的是，美国一些工厂是宝马、奔驰等车企巨头的重要出口基地。宝马和奔驰在美国工厂的停产将影响出口，预计出口到中国的车型会在8到12周后恢复。但这只是基于对美国疫情和在美国的汽车工厂的汽车零部件供应（包括进口和国内供应）较为乐观情况的估计。奥地利EFS汽车企业咨询有限公司CEO雷霆生(Truls Thorstensen)对第一财经记者表示。\n 除了欧美车企外，韩国车企也已参与到了工厂停产的队列中。现代汽车近日已宣布继其位于欧洲、美国及巴西的工厂后，其位于印度的工厂也将实施间歇性停产。在本次措施生效以后，现代汽车仅有韩国本土、中国、土耳其和俄罗斯的工厂仍在进行生产。值得注意的是，产能虽然受到了部分影响，但部分车企新车型的推出仍未受到影响。近日，现代汽车在美国洛杉矶举行第七代伊兰特车型的全球首秀活动，此外，现代汽车旗下豪华高端品牌杰尼西斯（Genesis）第三代G80轿车也在30日在韩国本土正式上市，上市当天的单日签约数量超过万辆，该数字相当于第二代G80去年一年在韩国本土销量的近一半。\n 韩国汽车工业协会（KAMA）运营委员长金泰年向第一财经记者表示，汽车工业是一个全产业链生产体系，缺少任何一个零部件车辆都不能出厂，且目前韩国的汽车产业搭建起了覆盖全球的供应链体系，因此疫情将对于汽车的生产也造成一定的影响。金泰年同时称，从未来展望来看，当亚洲国家的疫情有了一定的缓解以后，可以借助于全球化供应链的优势，通过将欧美的供应链及生产向亚洲转移，以减少疫情可能带来的风险。\n 现代汽车在近期参加由韩国产业通商资源部举办的恳谈会期间表示，愿意与政府和工会方面进行协商，就增加韩国本土工厂的工作时间，以提高产量，并修复由于此前疫情所导致的产量下降所带来的影响，同时将逐步恢复北京现代的产量。此外，丰田位于广州、长春和成都工厂目前正采取昼夜两班次的生产，并已开始提升中国市场的整体产能。\n 日本汽车工业协会（JAMA）负责人在回复第一财经记者的邮件时表示：疫情不仅会影响日本车企的销售，疫情带来的物流障碍及消费品的下降，还将对日本汽车产业的全球化步伐造成一定负面影响。\n 记者从全球数据分析公司LMC Automotive获得的一份报告显示，欧洲地区的主机厂计划在未来几周内削减近85万辆的产量。该报告指出，尽管供应链中断在一定程度上对工厂停产造成了影响，但更根本的原因是由于政府推出的限制活动的政策削弱了汽车市场需求，因此主机厂削减产量的目的还包括减少不必要的库存积压。\n 希望在七八月份恢复到以前的生产水平，很多车企的目标是在年底之前实现计划的年产量水平，但是重新启动整个汽车价值链中的生产可能比预期的更具挑战性。雷霆生(Truls Thorstensen)对第一财经记者表示，今年汽车公司将面临四大挑战，一是汽车价值链中断的同时会出现财务问题，而目前并非所有国家都会为确保业务连续性提供必要的财务支持，许多公司可能会破产倒闭；二是生一些地区可能会因为疫情，无法确保汽车零部件的生产和供应；三是一些车企的工厂本来产能就不足，现在疫情出现使这些工厂的生产更具挑战性，产品推向市场的节奏也会受到影响；四是汽车销售预计会衰退。\n 建议车企识别存在风险的零部件，并对整个价值链进行风险评估，优先生产和销售具供应链具备保障性的车辆，同时寻找零部件替代方案。雷霆生对记者表示，经济衰退时往往会出现新的机会，车企需要挖掘出潜力市场"

    "content": "Gasgoo News According to the data compiled by the European Automobile Industry Association (ACEA), as of March 30 local time, the factory shutdown caused by the new coronary pneumonia epidemic has directly affected 1,110,107 jobs in the European automobile manufacturing industry. This is only the number of people directly employed by manufacturers of passenger cars, trucks, light commercial vehicles, and buses. If the impact of the epidemic on the automotive supply chain is added, the data will be more severe.\n For now, the average cycle of European car companies to stop production is 16 working days, and the suspension will cause at least 1,231,038 motor vehicle production losses. If the shutdown period is prolonged or the number of shutdown factories is increased, the loss of production capacity will definitely increase.\n According to ACEA data, there are 229 automobile assembly and production plants in the EU, directly providing 2.6 million manufacturing jobs. Broadly speaking, the EU's automotive industry employs 13.8 million people directly or indirectly. It is understood that ACEA has a total of 16 members of major European manufacturers, including BMW Group, Daimler, FCA, Ford Europe, Honda Europe, Volkswagen Group, Volvo Group, Volvo Cars, Toyota Motor Europe, Renault Group, PSA Group, Jaguar Land Rover Wait.\n Among them, more than half of the affected people are in Germany. In Germany, nearly 570,000 automotive industry workers are affected by short-term work plans. Under the plan, the government can pay up to 67% of normal salary. The number of affected people in France is second only to Germany, with a total of 90,000 people affected; followed by the United Kingdom, with a total of 65,000 people affected.\n From the enterprise level, most of Daimler's 170,000 employees in Germany will have their working hours reduced; about 80,000 people are affected by Volkswagen, and about 20,000 employees of BMW will be on holiday . FCA takes a salary cut. From April to June this year, the salary of FCA's regular employees will be reduced by 20%, and the annual salary of its CEO Mike Manley will be halved.\n Regarding the sales of new cars in Europe this year, major institutions have also made predictions. Among them, IHS predicts that European car sales will be 15.6 million units in 2020, a 14% decrease (1.9 million units) from the previous forecast. Morgan Stanley expects European car sales to be around 12.5 million in 2020, compared with its previous forecast of 13.7 million. Scope Ratings’ forecast is even more pessimistic, and it predicts that sales in Western Europe will decline by 20% this year (3 million units)"

It is likely that there will be a shortage of funds in the next few weeks. Automakers are calling on the EU and EU member states to provide immediate support.\n According to data from the European Association of Automobile Manufacturers (hereinafter referred to as ACEA), so far, throughout the European Union, the total number of automobile production losses caused by factory shutdowns has reached 1.23 million vehicles, and about 1.11 million workers have been affected. This figure does not include Supply chain impact.\n There are a total of 229 automobile assembly and production plants in the EU, providing about 2.6 million jobs, and the broader automotive industry provides jobs for 13.8 million people.\n According to IHS predictions, European car sales this year are about 15.6 million units, a 14% decrease from the previous forecast. Morgan Stanley predicts that this year's European sales will be 12.5 million units, which is lower than the previous forecast of 13.7 million units.\n ACEA requires strong and coordinated action to help all automakers, suppliers and dealers facing severe financial blows.\n The impact of the new coronavirus on the automotive industry is unprecedented, and ACEA Chairman Eric-Mark Huitema said in a statement that it is becoming more and more obvious that it has caused the automobile The industry's worst crisis.\n Huitma believes that the severe consequences of the epidemic on the industry far exceed current forecasts. Therefore, he expressed the need for an urgent dialogue with Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission.\n First, take specific measures to avoid irreversible and fundamental damage to the industry caused by immunization, such as the loss of jobs, production capacity, innovation and research capabilities. Huitma said, secondly, we believe that Europe must be prepared to stimulate the recovery of the automotive industry, which will be a key factor to accelerate the overall recovery of the European economy.\n Recently, ACEA and other European industry associations for suppliers, distributors and tire manufacturers released a report that several companies may face a (cash) shortage in a few weeks and called on the EU to postpone the implementation of some important regulatory goals because The crisis has caused unforeseen obstacles.\n They said in a statement: Therefore, we believe that some adjustments need to be made to the timing of these regulatory laws.\n In view of the increasing damage caused by the new coronavirus epidemic to the European automotive industry, many companies have said that it is almost impossible to predict revenue.\n Compared with March 2019, French car registrations fell by 72%. According to data from industry organization BIL Sweden, Sweden’s car registrations fell by 8.6% in March. But the organization said that most of these cars were ordered a few months ago, so the decline in sales has nothing to do with the epidemic.\n We can expect that in the coming months, coronaviruses will have an impact on new car registrations. Mattias Bergman, head of BIL Sweden, said.\n In addition, the German supplier Continental Group has also canceled this year's financial guidance, and more than 40% of the factories have been closed. 50% of the group’s 60,000 German employees are on vacation and they have registered to receive state wage subsidies.\n Juergen Pieper, an analyst at Bankhaus Metzler, said new car sales for passenger cars and trucks are likely to be hit hardest since 1945.\n April will also be very difficult because people in many countries will still be restricted. French supplier Valeo CEO Jacques Aschenbroich told BFM Business Radio that we must prepare for the very, very difficult days that will follow in the coming months.\n Ashenbois said that Valeo is cutting investment and costs, and some employees (including development engineers) are in partial unemployment (Partial Unemployment). Most of our customers are suspending the development of new cars, so our team is also slowing down. He said that the transfer may come later this month, but we don’t know when"

    "content": "对于全球新能源市场而言，一场威力巨大的暴风雨已经无法避免，2月的片刻宁静也会在不久之后被打破。\n 此刻，或许谁都未曾料到新冠状病毒疫情的位于全球的蔓延速度会如此之快，受其影响，一些北美、欧洲国家的近况正在变得愈发糟糕。毫无疑问，我们已经迎来一场属于全人类的浩劫。\n 同时，噩耗还在不断传来，按照美国国家过敏症和传染病研究所所长福奇近日在访谈中的估计，新冠肺炎疫情在美国可能导致10万至20万人死亡，数百万人感染。英国官员称，英国可能需要6个月甚至更长时间才能恢复正常秩序。\n 而将目光聚焦于汽车制造业，可以预见疫情对于该细分市场的影响也将是毁灭性的。因为此刻，全球多家车企旗下工厂关闭停产、供应链中断、销量下滑、甚至裁员降薪等问题已经开始不断涌现出来。\n 根据加拿大皇家银行资本市场的数据显示，本次疫情对消费者需求的连锁反应可能会导致2020年美国汽车销量预计将下降20%，全球汽车产量下降16%，而下降16%带来的约1580万辆的损失已接近欧洲市场一年的总交付量。同时，已有行业专家表示，遭受重创的全球汽车产业的发展将会倒退10年，也就是2010年左右。\n 不可否认，灾难面前再过强大的车企都显得愈发渺小，当下它们能做的只有咬紧牙关、直面困境。虽然此刻悲怆的氛围笼罩着整个全球汽车市场，但是不妨仍有一些利好消息传出。例如，北京时间3月31日举行的国务院常务会议，正式宣布为促进汽车消费，中国新能源汽车购置补贴和免征购置税政策将再延长两年。换言之，业界最为关注的新能源汽车财政补贴将延期至2022年年底退出。\n 补贴延长对于我国一众发展中的自主新能源车企，以及更多即将于2020年发力该细分市场的合资车企而言，无疑都是一则重大利好消息。此外，根据EV Sales刚刚公布的2月全球新能源销量数据显示，虽然疫情之下情况仍然不容乐观，但是回暖迹象已显。在经历连续几月的负增长之后，2月全球新能源注册量终于超过去年同期，累计共交付116,170辆，同比增长16%。\n 不过必须承认，2月的暂时回暖注定不会持续很久，而它也带有着一丝暴风雨前最后的宁静之意味。因为整个2月除中国之外，全球疫情还未上升到大流行的程度。而随着3月病毒位于如美国、德国、英国等重要新能源细分市场的爆发，必将使其终端销量出现大幅下滑，从而影响全球。\n 所以既然已经预见风暴将会在不久之后降临，那么为何不好好享受当下片刻的宁静？毕竟2月的全球新能源市场不乏一些亮点。\n 如果说1月的全球新能源车型销量榜前十之中未见中国车企是它们的首次折戟，那么进入2月这样的状况并未得到改善，反而有着愈演愈烈的趋势。因为前二十之中，仅剩三款中国车型入围，即位列第17位的广汽新能源Aion S，位列第18位的名爵ZS EV，位列第20位的荣威Ei5，而其销量分别为1,433辆、1,351辆、277辆。\n 其中下滑最为严重的当属位列第20位的荣威Ei5，据悉其1月还以3,068辆的销量位居榜单第十一位。至于中国品牌2月整体销量疲软的最大原因还是由于疫情对于整体车市的严重冲击，加之春节假期延长、经销商迟迟未能开工等不利因素，造成了各家车企的销量断崖式下滑。\n 而且从入围的三款车型也能看出，目前中国新能源市场的销量结构仍为B重C轻，C端私人用户的缺失也从侧面反映出消费者对于电动汽车的实际接受程度并未有想象中高。\n 至于榜单首位，毫无疑问仍归属于特斯拉Model 3，整个2月其累计交付新车13,661辆，环比1月上升36.4%。而它也凭借连续13个月占据榜首位置的表现，成为了全球首款真正意义上可以挑战同级别传统燃油车的电动车型。\n 不过特斯拉旗下的高端车型Model S与Model Y处境却在变得糟糕，由于产品上市已久迟迟未能换代更新，潜在消费者有了性价比相对更高的Model 3，左右手互博下后者已经严重侵占它们的终端销量与目标客户。\n 同时，刚刚过去的3月或许才是特斯拉面临更大困境的开始。受疫情影响，目前除上海工厂之外，其位于美国本土的两座超级工厂已经陷入停工状态，何时恢复也是未知。所以面对不断上升的订单数，除中国市场外，特斯拉即将面对无车可交的尴尬局面。至于今年50万辆的交付目标，就现状而言，如数完成好似已经没有希望。同时，特斯拉想要超越2019年36万辆的成绩或许都存在一定变数。\n 此外，排名第2、3位的车型，依然为日产聆风与雷诺Zoe，不过二者处境却不相同。雷诺Zoe作为1月逼近特斯拉销量达到近万辆的强势车型，本月销量出现大幅下滑，仅交付新车6,495辆，排名也下降一位。而日产聆风作为纯电动市场的常青藤，继续维持稳定表现，2月共交付新车6,739辆，相较1月环比上升35.7%。\n 而本次榜单之中，最为令人惊喜的当属大众e-Golf，其本月强势交付4,093辆新车，排名也从上月的第8位上升至第4位。关于e-Golf终端表现如此良好的原因，或许还是与它较为巨大的折扣有关。此举不知也可认为是大众在加快消耗e-Golf的生命周期，为即将到来的大众ID.3让路。\n 除纯电之外的插混阵营，2月三菱欧蓝德PHEV首次超越宝马530e/Le，位居该细分板块首位。而它位于欧洲市场补贴后低至12万元人民币的超低售价，加之身为SUV车型带来的较大乘坐空间，或许是它获胜的主要原因。不过宝马作为目前传统车企位于新能源领域的头部品牌，2月之中仍有三款车型入围榜单，即位列第11位的宝马530e/Le，位列第13位的宝马i3，位列第15位的宝马330e，但是相较1月表现有所下滑。\n 北欧品牌沃尔沃旗下的插混车型XC60 PHEV本月销量还在持续走高，排名相较1月跃升5名来到榜单第12位。此外，值得注意的该品牌旗下的另一插混车型沃尔沃S/V60 PHEV，本月位居全球销量排名第21位，累计交付新车1,542辆，涨势明显。\n 如果说1月车企销量排行榜中，宝马凭借位于插混板块的强势，实现了对于特斯拉的反超，那么2月后者就凭借位于中国市场与本土市场的销量回暖，再次夺回了榜首位置，本月累计交付新车16,276辆，而其销量几乎是位居次席宝马的2倍。\n 但是取得如此成绩，特斯拉却无法沾沾自喜。因为3月随着疫情位于美国本土与欧洲的蔓延，即使中国市场有所回暖，也依然无法阻挡其Q1季度交付量的大大不及预期。而根据彭博社的预测，特斯拉2020年第一季度交付量约7.74万辆， 包括第一批Model Y的交付量。这一数字虽然较去年同期大幅提升，但是与去年Q4季度相比，环比下滑了逾30%。因此对于特斯拉而言，更大的困境或许即将降临。\n 至于位居第二的宝马，相较1月在销量上出现了超千辆的下滑，而背后的主要原因还是由于其主销车型5系插混涨势的暂时放缓。同时，由于宝马纯电车型i3已经推出许久，在与同级别、同价位产品的直面竞争之中，除品牌之外好似并无优势可言，所以一定程度上拖累了宝马的整体销量。后续，对于宝马的插混产品布局看似不需过多担心，但是其纯电板块看似急需一款证明自身实力的爆款车型。\n 在本月榜单之中，令人最为感到惊喜的莫过于大众汽车，得益于e-Golf、帕萨特插混等车型的销量回暖，其排名也成功超越雷诺进入榜单前三。而且在刚刚过去的大众2019财报会议中我们得知，下一阶段其电动化的转型将会更加激进。据其集团管理董事会主席迪斯博士表示，大众在2020年至2024年间将在混合动力、电动出行以及数字化领域投资600亿欧元。其中，纯电动领域的投资就高达330亿欧元，混合动力及数字化领域的投资为270亿欧元。\n 由此可以看出，大象转身对于大众而言，或许即将完成。此外，本月榜单之中，除大众汽车外，隶属于大众集团的奥迪、保时捷、斯柯达也成功入围，分别位于第10位、第17位、第18位。这也使得它们拥有了与雷诺-日产联盟相同的14%全球新能源市场份额。\n 反观中国车企，受疫情冲击2月中国新能源市场相较1月看似更加惨淡。据乘联会公布的数据显示，2月我国新能源乘用车批发销量为15,323辆，相较去年2月的50,783辆，同比下降70%。整体大环境堪忧反映到主机厂方面，2月全球车企排行榜中的自主品牌或许只能用集体失守形容。\n 因为前二十中仅有4家中国车企入围，分别是位列第13位的比亚迪、位列第15位的上汽、位列第19位的广汽、位列第20位的北汽。其中身为2019全球新能源总销量第2位的比亚迪，本月排名再次下滑4位，累计交付新车3,249辆。\n 不过对于中国品牌而言无需过多担心，因为随着市场活力逐渐恢复，同时伴随国家、各地政府一些列的救市措施纷纷出台，预计从3月开始中国新能源市场将会迎来逆势上行阶段。至于比亚迪、上汽、广汽、北汽般的传统主机厂，2020年还会大力度的位于新能源板块进行推新，所以其销量回归正轨或许只是时间问题。\n 总之，接下来的全球新能源市场受黑天鹅效应影响将会变得愈发混乱。一场威力巨大的暴风雨已经无法避免，2月的片刻宁静也会在不久之后被打破。面对这场浩劫，无论中国车企还是其它主机厂，能做的只有艰难面对。\n 可以确定的是，在这过程之中必定有很多抵御风险能力较差的车企接连倒下，因为行业大洗牌已经由于诸多外部因素的干扰提前到来"

    "title": "The epidemic caused French car sales to drop 72% in March",
    "content": "Gasgoo News According to data from the French Automobile Industry Association CCFA, in March, due to the pandemic of the new corona virus, car dealerships were closed, and French car sales fell 72% to 62,688 vehicles.\n On March 16, the French government imposed strict restrictions on transportation and commercial activities across the country, and car dealership stores were closed. But in fact, before this, the government suggested that people work from home to avoid unnecessary travel and contact. Other countries that have adopted blockade measures due to the epidemic may also experience similar sales declines. For example, in February, China’s car sales fell by 80%.\n Analysts predict that European car sales will drop by more than 20% in 2020, depending on the duration of the blockade measures and whether governments have introduced incentive plans to stimulate car demand.\n Last month, French car brands were almost completely wiped out, and sales have all dropped sharply. The only car brand whose sales volume fell by less than 50% was the high-end brand DS under the PSA Group, and its March sales fell by 38% year-on-year. Other relatively well-performing brands include Mini, with sales down 50% year-on-year; Kia, sales down 53% year-on-year; Toyota and Hyundai saw 57% year-on-year declines, respectively.\n Brands with more severe sales losses include Opel, a subsidiary of PSA Group, which fell 89% year-on-year; Jeep, which belongs to FCA Group, fell 85% year-on-year, while sales of Fiat, Seat and Suzuki fell by 82% respectively.

    "content": "文｜郭文静\n 图｜来源网络\n 前两个月在中国上演的剧情，现在正在全球各地反复重演。\n 对于汽车企业来说，2020年的开局着实不好，原本以为疫情只是中国市场的区域问题，没想到中国工厂刚刚复工复产，疫情就蔓延到了全球，而且形势比中国还要严峻，跨国车企的欧美工厂不得不大面积停工停产。\n 更令人担忧的是，由于海外疫情目前仍处于扩散阶段，各个国家的疫情防控工作才刚刚开始，所以很难预测这些国家和地区的疫情走势，车企自然也无法预测工厂停工停产的时间，更难以估计疫情会对今年全球汽车市场造成怎样的影响，但目前来看，大家都不乐观。\n 据CNBC报道，加拿大皇家银行资本市场的数据显示，新型冠状病毒肺炎疫情对消费者需求的连锁反应可能会导致2020年全球汽车产量下降16%，美国汽车销量预计将下降20%；汽车分析机构lmc automotive则预测，\n 即便是疫情已经控制住的中国，全年产销形势也不乐观，全国乘用车市场信息联席会秘书长崔东树表示，如果年内国家层面不出台强有力的政策刺激，那么受疫情影响，全年国内汽车零售量将同比下滑8%。\n 覆巢之下，难有完卵。全球汽车产业链中各个环节的企业，都不得不开始一场自救，而在疫情席卷全球的态势下，率先控制住疫情的中国会成为汽车产业链上下游企业的避风港吗？\n 全球100余家工厂被迫停工\n 受疫情影响，欧美车企也不得不停工停产，而且随着疫情扩散，这些车企的停工停产规模或将继续扩大。据媒体统计，截至目前，包括戴姆勒、大众、菲亚特克莱斯勒集团（FCA）、标致雪铁龙集团（PSA）等在内的14家海外车企，已经关停或计划关停的工厂将超过100家。\n 其中，欧洲地区形势最为严峻，已经关停的工厂将超过90家。3月16日，PSA集团宣布从即日起关闭在欧洲的所有工厂，关闭时间将持续到3月27日，涉及15家工厂；大众集团从3月16日起，也开始陆续暂停其位于欧洲各国的工厂，停产时间或将持续三周；总部位于疫情重灾区意大利的FCA集团自然也逃不掉停工停产的命运，近日其宣布欧洲大部分工厂将停工停产直至3月27日。\n 目前来看，大部分车企的欧洲工厂停产时间都暂定为两周，但包括PSA、大众、戴姆勒、宝马等在内的绝大部分车企都表示，停工停产时间要根据疫情发展态势而定，而此前世卫组织曾表示，\n 美国的形势并没有比欧洲好多少。3月19日，通用、福特和其他制造商宣布，将停止在美国的生产。福特宣布，其位于美国、加拿大和墨西哥的工厂将在周四工作日结束后关闭两周；通用汽车也宣布将立即关闭工厂，停产将至少持续到3月30日；FCA也宣布将在3月底之前关闭所有工厂。据美媒报道，这三家企业宣布停产将导致约15万名工人回家待业。\n 同时，日韩的汽车工厂，因为对海外零部件依赖较重，此次受到的冲击也不小，此前因为中国零部件企业的停工停产，这些工厂已经出现了停工待零部件的局面，而随着日韩两国本土疫情的爆发，这些工厂更是陷入了全面停工停产中。\n 中国成汽车相关企业避风港？\n 相比之下，目前中国成了反而成了车企能够正常生产的市场。3月11日，位于湖北的多家车企工厂和零部件企业获批有序复工，作为中国四大汽车生产基地之一，2019年湖北省汽车产量为224.75万辆，占全国的8.8%，且有超百家汽车上下游产业链公司位于武汉。\n 春节期间的新冠肺炎疫情爆发，导致湖北制造业全线停摆，有数据显示，湖北省内多家车企及约1300家零部件供应商被迫停产，影响波及全国甚至全球产业链，2月初现代起亚汽车就宣布，由于中国零部件供应出现中断，企业将在韩国暂停生产，而受影响的企业远不止现代一家。\n 基于这种情况，有声音认为，中国或成车企避风港，尤其是零部件企业，考虑到中国巨大的市场和较好的基础设施配套、运营成本、交通运输条件、制造业文化，以及中国政府应对突发情况的能力，汽车产业链仍将加速向中国汇集。\n 中国首席经济学家论坛副理事长褚建芳认为，考虑到国内汽车制造商本土化率较高，零部件等国产供应相对充足，部分汽车零部件断供的负面影响也能部分对冲，而国内上市公司在日韩竞争对手为主的汽车零部件细分领域供应有望因此得到提升。\n 然而，对这一观点持反对态度的行业人士也不少，反对声认为，众所周知，一辆汽车上的零部件大约有2-3万辆，任何一个零部件的供应出现异常，都会导致车辆无法正常生产，而汽车产业早已进入全球化生产阶段，仅仅依靠单一市场是不可能实现零部件正常供应的，疫情在海外市场肆虐，也会导致位于中国的整车工厂停产。\n 如果疫情继续在海外蔓延，导致零部件企业长期停工停产，就算中国工厂已经复工，最终也会因为海外零部件的断供而停产，这对中国汽车产业来说根本不是什么机会。崔东树强调。\n 此时都应该在充分认识到这一点的基础上，积极整合国内外资源，尽可能确保正常生产，而抵消疫情对今年全球汽车产业影响的最好方式，或许还是疫情结束后如何让消费复苏，毕竟疫情是暂时的，但消费需求是始终存在的"

    "content": "文/ 杨光\n 2019或许是过去十年里最差的一年，但却很有可能是未来十年里最好的一年。\n 这句被视为当下中国汽车市场最客观真实的描述，如今套用在全球汽车产业之上或许一点都不为过。\n 据不完全统计，截至上周，包括戴姆勒、大众、菲亚特克莱斯勒、标致雪铁龙等在内的12家海外车企已经关停或计划关停的工厂总数已超过100家。\n 用国内媒体的话讲，当两个月前我们还在为中国车市停摆而感到焦虑时，事实上这只是全球汽车产业链全面告急的前奏。\n 衰退会有多严重？现阶段恐无人能给出明确的答案。\n 但唯一可以确认的是，在这场危机面前，没有谁可以独善其身。\n 全球知名市场研究机构IHSMarkit近日发布的一份报告指出，汽车及汽车零部件将成为2020年受打击最为严重的行业。\n 这绝非危言耸听。\n 2月，欧盟乘用车市场注册量同比下降7.4%，这是欧洲汽车销量自2013年以来的最差开局。\n 3月，底特律三大汽车巨头通用汽车、福特汽车、FCA股价跌幅均超过30%，创下近52周来的新低。\n 不少美国经销商表示，近期的客流量开始出现明显下降，而即使是尚未报告有新型冠状病毒的地区也同样如此。\n 摩根士丹利最新的调研报告显示，2020年美国汽车销量或将下降9%。\n 一则最新消息是，法国政府甚至不排除使用国有化手段，以挽救本国因疫情遭受损失的PSA集团和雷诺集团。\n 多家权威机构预测，新冠疫情所带来的连锁反应可能会导致全球汽车产量下降16%左右，而这一数字已经接近欧洲市场一年的销售量（约1580万辆）。\n 宏观经济学和金融机构专家、凯里商学院副教授亚历山德罗·雷布奇认为，诸多的不确定性因素正导致人们推迟消费，企业延迟或取消投资，而产出降低则意味着收入的降低，失业和利润下降，由此引发支出减少，这是一个恶性循环。\n 对于欧美等发达国家来说，这些地区的汽车普及量是中国的三倍以上，由于人们的购车需求并不迫切，因此未来车市受到冲击后复苏的难度反而会更大。乘联会秘书长崔东树告诉腾讯汽车。\n 事实上目前汽车行业早已进入利润沙漠时代，无论利润率还是资本使用回报率都已降到2008年经济大萧条时期以来的最低水平。\n 就在上周，停工潮正式从欧洲蔓延至北美，通用、福特、FCA宣布关闭其在美国的工厂，涉及员工人数超过15万。\n 据外媒推算，欧洲工厂平均关停13天，将导致该地区汽车总产量减少超88万辆，北美工厂平均关闭时长6天，该地区产量将减少约50万辆。\n 一位业内资深人士在接受腾讯汽车采访时表示：关闭生产线的负面作用远大于'慢拍'生产节奏。如果时隔半年以上才对生产线实行冷启动，则可能需要重建供应链，而期间无论是遣散员工还是照常发薪，都会对车企的现金流构成严重的挑战。\n 事实上几乎没有企业会在手边留存应付3个月的现金。这意味着若拿不到贷款，很多工厂将会垮掉。该人士强调。\n 机遇与思考\n 准时制（Just-In-Time）是当下制造业中应用最为广泛的管理模式之一，它强调极低的库存与更高的效率。\n 然而汽车产业庞大的上下游链条也决定了这一模式在应对突发状况时的局限性。\n 如果算上二级和三级，那么一家车企背后的零部件供应商总数往往在千家以上，其中任何一家供应商因故延期交货，那么工厂生产就会受到影响。一位车企内部人士透露。\n 北京理工大学机械与车辆学院副教授王欣指出，当供应链出现意外情况时，许多车企往往来不及寻找合适的替代者。\n 有研究表明，汽车行业中只有11%的公司制定了应对突发状况的供应商备选计划。\n 全球任何一家零部件供应商的停工都可能导致装配线陷入停顿状态，尤其许多海外巨头的零部件不少都产自中国，所以如果中国的零部件供应商不能够很快恢复运营，其影响将是巨大的。王欣说。\n 相关统计数据显示，我国汽车零部件企业数量超过10万家，其中规上企业超过1.3万家。\n 尤其作为全球汽车零部件的重要供应基地，湖北相关企业的复工复产对于稳定全球汽车产业链无疑将起到至关重要的作用。\n 好消息是，当前我国机械工业重点企业的复工复产率已从2月13日的不足30%提升至3月18日的89.71%。\n 湖北从3月11日起开工率也在逐日增长。中国机械工业联合会相关人士表示。\n 另一组值得关注的数据是，3月第二周我国日均零售乘用车辆数达到21696辆，相较于第一周的16666辆环比增长了30.18%。\n 除了零售领域的情况出现改善外，乘联会还透露，近期车企的批发数量也有所增长，整体需求呈现出逐步回暖的态势。\n J.D. Power在18日发布的报告中也表达了对汽车市场复苏的信心：与飞机座椅和食品不同，汽车是耐用品，汽车行业历来都有把短期销售中断而产生的销售损失弥补回来的能力。\n 不过站在更高的层面出发，汽车产业的至暗时刻只是全球经济的一个缩影。\n 也正如董扬所说，疫情对各行业都有重大影响，汽车只是其中之一，我们不应该过多强调自己的困难，而应该更多考虑汽车作为国民经济支柱产业应有的担当。\n 汽车行业已经为防控疫情作出重大贡献，今后还应为国民经济的全面恢复作出更大的贡献"

    "content": "截至目前，中国以外受疫情影响的国家和地区已经达到135个之多。最近一周，我们见证了在这场全球范围内的疫情面前海外各个国家的花样抗疫，也见证了美股有史以来的三次熔断。\n 疫情叠加经济下行，给全球范围内的汽车产业蒙上了一层阴影。2月，国内车市遭遇本世纪以来罕见的巨大跌幅，但由于疫情在2月份更集中在国内，所以车企们均将增长的目标放在了海外市场。\n 事实上，2月份，在各车企清一色下跌的产销快报中，也确实出现了增长的暖流，而这里的增长，基本聚焦在出口销量上。比如，上汽集团2月份实现整车车口及海外零售量2.1万台，同比增长32%；而奇瑞汽车2月出口及海外市场零售销量为8419台，同比增长39.9%。\n 由此来看，2月，虽然国内车市进入冰封期，但中国车企在海外市场取得了明显增长，堪称车市严冬中的一股暖流。\n 然而，3月份开始，疫情在全球范围内的迅速蔓延，则加剧了这股暖流冷却的速度。\n 从中国车企出海征战的地区和市场来看，现阶段中国车企在海外的落脚点基本集中在东南亚、中东、北非、南美地区，部分车企也在积极拓展欧洲和北美市场。\n 我们来看看疫情在以上地区的发展态势。\n 截至3月17日，马来西亚、泰国、印度尼西亚、菲律宾、新加坡、巴基斯坦、印度、沙特阿拉伯、科威特等地，累计确诊人数均超过100人。其中，\n 疫情在东南亚和中东等地的蔓延，带给汽车行业最直接的影响就是停工关厂。以印度为例，因疫情导致汽车零部件出现大面积断供，位于印度的塔塔汽车、马恒达、TVS Motor等车企表示，其正面临零部件断供的问题，而部分企业已宣布暂停生产。\n 此前，塔塔汽车曾发布内部公告称，从3月16日起，该公司要求总部和其它地区的办公室员工在家办公。与此同时，该公司还采取了暂停员工国际差旅等举措，来应对持续蔓延的疫情。\n 而位于南美的巴西，也正在遭受此次疫情的冲击。据统计，\n 巴西经济部16日出台了系列措施，以缓解新冠肺炎疫情对经济的负面影响，并着力扶持弱势群体。其中包括投入1473亿巴西雷亚尔应急资金，其中594亿雷亚尔用于保障就业。\n 疫情对巴西汽车产业影响目前主要体现在中国零部件断供可能带来的停产风险。因巴西的汽车零部件大部分依赖中国，所以，此次中国零部件断供预计将在4月份对巴西的汽车制造业带来负面影响。\n 前文提到，东南亚、中东和南美地区是中国整车企业出口的重地。比如，\n 与东南亚、非洲、南美等地相比，欧洲是除中国以外受疫情影响最严重的地区。截至3月17日，意大利累计确诊人数已超过3万人，同时也是欧洲范围内第一个实施全国封锁措施的国家；而西班牙的确诊人数也已超过1万人，仅次于意大利，目前，西班牙也已实施封锁政策。这一政策的实施，也使得欧洲的汽车制造业面临大面积停工停产。\n 据报道，\n 同样，疫情也蔓延到北美地区，截至3月18日，美国累计确诊人数已超过6000人。据外媒报道，\n 当然，欧洲和北美的汽车产业相对成熟，目前有实力的中国车企在欧美市场大都设有研发和营销中心，但鲜有投资建厂者。比如，上汽目前在美国硅谷、英国伦敦、特拉维夫建立3大研发中心。基于此，\n 可以说，现阶段，中国车企还在努力扩充在欧美地区的版图。今年，\n 值得一提的是，俄罗斯市场一向是中国品牌出海必经之地。如今，奇瑞、吉利、长城、力帆等均将俄罗斯作为海外主战场之一，其中，长城和力帆分别在俄罗斯的图拉州和佩茨克州建有工厂。去年，长城汽车在俄罗斯的图拉工厂正式投产，这也直接带动了长城汽车在俄罗斯的销量。数据显示，2019年，长城哈弗在俄罗斯市场的增长率高达289%，跃居中国汽车品牌在俄销量冠军。\n 如今，疫情在欧洲持续恶化的背景下，俄罗斯的疫情防控也逐渐严峻起来。截至3月17日，俄境内累计确诊人数为114例，其中有104例是输入性病例。鉴于此，俄罗斯的疫情防控措施也正在逐步升级。而俄罗斯的防控升级必将对当地的汽车产销造成一定影响。\n 据国家海关总署发布的数据显示，今年1-2月，我国汽车出口量为15.2万辆，同比微增0.5%；出口额20.24亿美元，同比下降1.3%。而2019年全年，我国汽车出口量为121.8万辆，增速为6.2%，出口额为153.41亿美元，同比增长3.3%。今年1-2月，汽车出口相对于2019年全年增速减少了5.7个百分点，出口额增幅由正增长转为负增长。\n 分析人士认为，\n 2月份，虽然如上汽、奇瑞、吉利、长城等国内车企，在海外市场实现了不错的增长，但与2019年相比，我国汽车出口量正在收缩。而3月份，随着疫情在海外蔓延范围的加剧，以及各国疫情防控工作的升级，各个国家和地区的汽车产销或出现不同程度的下滑，这也势必影响中国汽车在海外市场的销量表现。\n 目前，上汽、奇瑞等多家企业在接受盖世汽车采访时均表示，疫情对3月份出口销量以及海外市场零售量的影响当前还无法评估。但从车市大环境来看，3月中国汽车出口量恐再度收窄"

    "content": "作者 | 王秋凤\n 截至北京时间3月22日11时，全球新冠肺炎病例已超过30万例，疫情已波及全球182个国家和地区。席卷全球的疫情，很可能将全球经济逼向衰退的边缘——如果到夏天还未在主要工业国家结束的话。\n 中国应对疫情的方式，是采取经济冷启动策略。此举起初被外界批评，但事实证明这是最有效、也是最快恢复社会秩序的一种。疫情首先摧毁了消费，其次摧毁了依附于其上的工业生产、供应链。金融服务则因为经济的冷却、失去前景期盼而资产大幅抛售。\n 价值链遭受的打击，在汽车全球生产链条上，表现得淋漓尽致。据不完全统计，在疫情影响下，全球已有超14家车企的108家汽车工厂有停产计划或已经停产。德国相关机构发布报告预测全球新车销量将下降9%。眼下国内生产、物流逐渐恢复，海外却进入重度阻隔状态。疫情最严重的欧洲，汽车生产已经陷入停滞，正如疫前期间的武汉一样。底特律三大虽情况稍好，但全球物流严重受阻之下零部件供应不上很快也将进入空转。对于欧美车企来说，即便暂时能维持生产，也将很快面临零配件短缺。全球同此凉热，哪里都不是净土。\n 疫情终会过去。问题是，我们能否适应残垣遍地的后时代？\n 截至目前，关于疫情蔓延的最悲观预期已经成为现实，全球所有工业国家和G20成员无一幸免。对全球贸易和分工体系的破坏力，达到人类历史的顶峰。疫情对生命的毁伤能力不及二战的万分之一，但论及对全球财富的毁灭效应，前者可能大于后者。原因有二，一、战后75年人类创造的财富比过去几千年都要多；二、全球化的附加价值，也容易暴露于全球化风险面前。\n 危机一来，链条越长的，不确定因素越多。这和平时链条越长越稳定的表征截然相反。美股接连4次一级熔断前后，汽车为首的工业股跌幅居前（跌了40%以上），可见一斑。\n 汽车生产因其特有的供应长链，面临处处受制的窘境。\n 在战后第一个真正意义上的全球资产风险面前，任何预测都将失效，无论中期还是短期。有预测称，2020年全球汽车产销量将因此下跌16%-20%。但预测的前提是3个月内疫情全面消退。\n 眼下，没有证据表明，全球范围内的疫情能在6月份前结束；也无人能够判断，疫情是否会出现反复和卷土重来。面对无法忽略的未知因素，全球经济正在面临空前的挑战。无论投资还是大宗消费，都惧怕财务前景的不确定性。\n 近日，欧洲商会、欧盟委员会经济事务专员同时发出预警，欧洲汽车生产已经陷入停滞。\n 截至目前，包括戴姆勒、大众、菲亚特克莱斯勒集团（FCA）、标致雪铁龙集团（PSA）等在内的14家跨国车企已经关停或计划关停的工厂将超过100家，其中有90家位于欧洲。\n 在欧洲疫情爆发之前的2月份，欧盟汽车销量只有95.7万辆，创下2013年最差开局。\n 其中意大利和西班牙的企业遭受最为沉重的打击。而英国、德国、法国则进入很难逆转的爆发前夜。\n 11日，意大利宣布封国之后，境内外的供应链随之断裂。豪华车品牌玛莎拉蒂、兰博基尼和法拉利纷纷关闭工厂，理由都是供应链中断。FCA宣布欧洲所属企业停产至3月27日。可以肯定的是，停产令将会顺延下去，直到疫情解除。鉴于FCA的产能占据意大利的40%，可以说意大利的整车生产从3月初的低速变为近乎停滞。\n 有消息称，意大利3月的新车注册下降90%。在整个国家陷入危机的时候，汽车企业没有出声恳求政府救助，后者已经自顾不暇。工人们放假回家，大多数人得到了整薪，但没有加班费等附加收入。\n 相比欧洲，底特律三大情况稍微好一些。一方面所处的疫情阶段比较早期，另一方面，他们2018年就开始的、大刀阔斧的裁员和关闭工厂的举措，让如今的通用和福特负担轻了不少。目前，三大（包括FCA北美）在美国还拥有15万名雇员，不及上世纪通用一家的雇员数。\n UAW（北美汽车工人联合会）和资方达成协议，轮流关闭工厂，采取慢拍生产体制，以减少员工互相接触。虽然联邦官方仍在故作轻松，但有点见识的管理者，仍然了解问题的严重性。\n 三大暂时没有放弃各自盈利车型的生产，包括凯迪拉克、F-150皮卡和Jeep牧马人。\n 不过，北美疫情前景不妙。3月19日，福特表示将关闭北美工厂至3月30日，通用也发布了相同的计划，特斯拉撤回所有在德国的美籍员工，本田则宣布关闭北美工厂一周，以上厂家都称要彻底对厂区消毒。\n 欧美车厂，即便暂时能维持生产，也将很快面临零配件短缺，进入空转。除非他们能迅速转移零部件供应方。在多数情况下，很难快速地做到这一点。\n 中国则正成为零部件生产的低风险区域。原因自然在于，中国正处于疫情发展的尾声，生产节奏正在恢复正常。\n 中国的零部件出口，只占据世界零部件贸易量的6.8%。这中国汽车市场的体量不符，但该数字正在快速攀升。传统观点认为，它们大多数都是可以替代的，技术含量不高，因而中国并不占据零部件体系的重要位置。但疫情一来，就会发现，替代性、技术含量，以及在价值链中的地位，根本不是一回事。\n 而中国零部件出口，正在将周边国家的整车生产纳入辐射范围。韩国破天荒地核准中国零部件24小时紧急通关流程，以便应对供应链危机。\n 而印度进口零部件的27%是中国产品，原材料则占据10%。印度也采取了简化版入港提交手续，加快物流速度。\n 如果个别零部件只有一个国家能够生产，对于整车企业来说，没有B计划，代表糟糕的供应链管理。毕竟，低库存是整车生产的圭臬。它依赖于准时制生产和物流的畅通。关键节点一旦出了岔子，将殃及整个准时制体制。\n 疫情恰恰打击了全球紧急物流系统。受国际航空港纷纷关闭或者限流的影响，航空货运几乎停止。海运周期动辄以月计算，在中国的零部件生产厂停工期间，海外整车厂商都不断发电询问供应。他们担心的是一两个月之后的供应。\n 湖北省拥有零部件企业1300多家，全国1.3万家规模化零部件企业。虽然生产正在恢复，但由于物流运输时间差，当前临近海外生产基地正在受困于零部件短缺。\n 现在看来，对疫情的控制能力，成为供应链安全的胜负手。\n 德国依赖的中国仪表板和内饰产品，运输周期6周。他们一度评估，从西班牙重新遴选供应商，是不是更保险一些。但西班牙疫情蔓延，很快打消了德国人的想法。\n 2月份，伟福科技宣布将其武汉工厂产能转移至菲律宾工厂，罗姆半导体也表示将在泰国等东南亚国家进行替代生产。但此举尚未成型的时候，菲律宾进入了国家紧急状态。所谓供应链出逃，不可能在1、2个月之内完成。\n 与此相反，由于中国强有力的动作，没有事实上丢失阵地。零部件生产反而加速向中国汇集。中国市场固有的吸纳能力，要求跨国零部件企业必须在中国部署产能。而疫情发展到现在，强化了这一点。中国的劳动力成本已经高于东南亚、非洲和墨西哥、巴西。但是国家营商治理环境和基础设施等，可以弥补劳动力成本差距。\n 当前，中国正在规模化的进口替代战略。随着汽车智能化、网联化不断发展，汽车的电子器件集成度和复杂度越来越高。中国正在大规模投资芯片设计和生产，进而影响汽车半导体产业布局。\n 半导体产业发达的日韩，优势在于芯片制造和封测。中国正在逐步发展光刻机、激光刻蚀等上游产业，与日韩企业收窄差距。疫情既然基本被控制，中国产业降级和被替代的风险都比较小。\n 不过，疫情加剧了全球汽车市场的下滑。而中欧排放法规的相继落地，迫使厂家调整长期产品战略，电动产品规划在中期将压过燃油车产品。这已经导致全球就业市场大震荡。而疫情的发展，令其雪上加霜。\n 与此同时，企业现金流也承受巨大压力。在市场恢复后，压力会逐渐缓解。但供应链因此发生的深刻变化，正在改变全球汽车生产的面貌——将更趋向于更短链条（提高集成化）、就近部署产能和投资于低风险地区。而低风险本身，在疫情之后，将被重新定义。\n -E N D-\n 秋凤空间\n 无肇因之始，无自限之垣\n 品茗聚友，坐而论道。\n 如果你对于汽车产业、前沿科技、市场营销等\n 有独到见解，或是作为汽车人有自己的心得感悟\n 欢迎与我们分享"

However, in the process of difficult resumption of production, these enterprises not only faced the problem of employee safety protection, but also adapted to the market demand and the uncertainty of upstream parts supply. If they want to return to the normal track of operations and manufacturing, there is still a long way to go Way to go.\n This is the first line of normality that is currently preparing for resumption of production:\n The canteens of most of the factories will be closed to avoid the risk of large-scale gathering of infection among workers; the meeting process is also forced by the management to shorten the time, communicate and communicate online as much as possible, and the number of participants involved is also higher than before the outbreak Significantly reduced; employees involved in production wear protective clothing and masks, and wear electronic vibration wristbands to maintain a safe distance between everyone...\n Hyundai and Kia are the first car brands to decide to resume production in Europe. According to the plan, Hyundai Motor will implement a two-shift system at the Nosovice factory in the Czech Republic after the resumption of production, instead of the three-shift system in the normal period to ensure that appropriate Health protection measures.\n Volvo also said that the factories in Sweden and Belgium will reopen in mid-April and provide a temperature check at the main entrance of the factory, as well as a series of forms to fill out. Among them, Sweden's Olofstrom body plant is one of Volvo's first restored production lines. The plant mainly provides related parts for Volvo's China vehicle market. The subsequent capacity of the plant will gradually be released as the epidemic slows.\n Volkswagen plans to resume production at the Zwickau plant in Germany and Bratislava in Czechoslovakia from April 20. The former will produce a pure electric model ID3 for Volkswagen, which is the company's electrification The flagship product of the times, while the latter is a multi-brand factory, the related production line will return to normal together with the Zwickau factory.\n After pressing the restart button at these two major production bases, Volkswagen also plans to resume its factories in Germany, Portugal, Spain, Russia, South Africa, North America and South America on April 27, followed by factories in these regions, but It doesn't mean that all production lines will run at full speed in one step.\n Bernd Osterloh, chairman of the VW Works Council, said in a press release that their top priority is still the risk of epidemic infection among the company’s employees, but the company has never developed, produced and sold under such special conditions. After the automotive products, the final output will also depend on other comprehensive factors, including the availability of components and consumer demand, because unknown factors will appear at any time.\n Like Volkswagen, Daimler and its union have negotiated safety measures after resumption of work, and are planning to start production around the end of April, although some parts and components needed for production will not start again until April 20. According to the information disclosed by a Daimler spokesperson, the first batch of factories to resume production will be in shift operation.\n Toyota Motor’s European branch said recently that they planned to start production at the Valenciennes plant in France on April 22, and models such as Yaris were included in the first batch of resumption of production, but Compared with normal operation, the output will decrease significantly.\n In order to ensure the safety of employees and stakeholders, Toyota has adopted prudent protective measures for the resumption of production in European factories, including marking on the floor to ensure the distance between front-line workers, and holding meetings in a smaller number of groups and in shorter time.\n This has almost become the standard for automakers to resume production in Europe, and Fiat Chrysler will implement a similar procedure. In addition, workers will issue a safety kit every day, which is equipped with two masks and a new pair Gloves, and workers involved in the cleaning process must use safety glasses"

It is expected that 1.82 million transmission parts will be exported to PSA throughout the year.\n To this end, the Xiangyang plant started the dual shift 11+11 production mode only 4 days after the official resumption of work to increase production capacity, and it is 6.5 days a week, which has become the busiest business unit of the company.\n In Chongqing, 1,000 kilometers away from Wuhan, Lifan is also experiencing a similar situation.\n The 2019 annual report shows that Lifan's business focus will return to the motorcycle sector, and fuel vehicles and new energy vehicles must use existing resources to return funds as soon as possible.\n Therefore, although the production qualification of passenger cars has been sold to cars and homes, Lifan has been cultivating overseas markets for many years, which has allowed Lifan to receive some orders from Africa and other places.\n What is little known is that Lifan's revenue from overseas operations has always been at a relatively high level of overall revenue. In the past two years, overseas revenue has even exceeded domestic revenue.\n From the industry's point of view, re-exports from domestic sales can be regarded as a livelihood, but the current sporadic exports are somewhat inflated.\n Of course, Lifan, who can't switch passenger cars, also has a motorcycle.\n Public information shows that Lifan Motorcycle's export scope covers more than 160 countries and regions in the world, and has a large voice in many markets. In the first two months of this year, the cumulative sales of Lifan motorcycles reached 97,477, a year-on-year increase of 25.29%.\n The founder of the company, Yin Mingshan, once said that when it comes to building cars, our strategy is to play if we win, or run if we don’t\n Perhaps, it will become the last life-saving straw for Lifan to protect his base.\n If the overseas business is the last opportunity for the edge car companies, then in the eyes of some head companies, the epidemic brought a rethinking of its overseas strategy.\n Especially for companies that have frequently shot in the past two years, such as Great Wall Geely, a brief shutdown is also a rare self-check.\n The first is the supply chain system.\n Not long ago, Li Shufu admitted that although most of Geely’s parts have been localized, a small part still needs to rely on imports, and this has also affected Geely during the epidemic.\n In his words, only by better realizing localization, mastering the true core technology, and forming the advantages of the upstream and downstream industry chains, can we minimize the loss when some unexpected situations occur.\n The epidemic will also promote the in-depth localization of parts and components of various car companies, especially some core parts and raw materials, we must increase independent research and development efforts. An industry veteran analyzed.\n Secondly, the anti-risk ability of auto companies.\n Great Wall Motor believes that although the overall epidemic has little impact on its globalization strategy, it should also look for opportunities in crisis.\n In this company's view, it is necessary to make forward-looking strategic planning and timely adjustment of market strategies in light of the current new situation, in order to enhance the company's overall resilience and anti-risk capabilities.\n Although the feelings are different, the attitude towards going out is surprisingly consistent.\n The voices of Li Shufu and Wei Jianjun, two heads of private enterprises, are also the most representative.\n The former emphasizes that it is difficult to win the competition under the new situation alone, so it is necessary to exchange capital for technology to achieve globalization, and the latter believes that going out is the only way to realize the value of an enterprise, even if it is dead abroad. challenge.\n Omae Kenichi (a famous Japanese management scientist) said that at this stage, the capabilities of a company will be reflected in the risk hedging of the invisible future and the layout of the visible future.\n And if nothing goes wrong, according to various plans, Lectra will enter Europe this year, Chery will enter North America next year, and the Great Wall will enter the EU.\n The overseas road of independent brands has just begun"

    "content": "China News Service, Huayu News, according to Oulang.com, Spain will lift the alarm status activated from March 14 to next Monday from June 21 to resume national circulation, but some serious epidemic regions such as Madrid may release Slowing the unblocking operation, the Madrid Region said today that although the national warning will be lifted next week, the Madrid Region will continue to impose some restrictions. Therefore, together next week, most of Spain's regions will enter the new normal, but each region will formulate regulations in this region to prevent new outbreaks.\n Basque Country: The outbreak of the epidemic occurred in the past week. The serial transmission from the two hospitals infected a total of nearly 60 people, but the region said that the two epidemic sites have been controlled. To this end, Basque Regional Government Chairman I igo Urkullu today applied for the Bacchus region to lift the alarm status from this Friday, but in view of the new situation in the region, Basque Country needs to be released in advance for the Spanish government to approve.\n The region of Castile Leon reported bad news on the 16th. The regional health department said it has identified two new transmission points in two private nursing homes in Valladolid province. Currently, 5 cases and 11 cases are diagnosed. In addition, Yesterday, a new outbreak was also discovered at Hospital Río Hortega hospital in this province. One patient and two doctors were diagnosed. The region has taken isolation and observation measures for 140 contacts. The Regional Government Health Director Ms. Verónica Casado said today that it is important to be cautious at the moment, because the virus continues to circulate, she pointed out that it is important to maintain interpersonal distance, wash hands frequently and wear masks. This region may continue to implement the current outbreak control measures from next week.\n Region of Madrid: Region Chairperson Isabel Díaz Ayuso announced that the Madrid Region Government is developing new regulations to prevent new outbreaks of coronaviruses. She said that we believe it is best to leave the alarm state from Monday, We are making a decree that will be submitted on Thursday or Friday, this is a regulation on how we will move and spend a quiet summer in Madrid in the coming months. The virus is still around us and we must avoid any new outbreaks.\n This implies that Madrid's many restrictions to control the epidemic will continue to be effective next week. Madrid is still in Phase 2, but Madrid has decided not to apply to enter Phase 3. After the national alarm state is lifted, it is meaningless to enter Phase 3, so Madrid will manage the epidemic itself from next week.\n La Razon said that although there is no formal phase 3, Madrid will enter phase 3 next week, because the regional regulations being formulated by the Madrid regional government have copied many of the restrictions of phase 3 into the new regulations of the Madrid region For example, customers in shopping malls accept no more than 75% of the capacity, and it is forbidden to fully open the doors in nightlife places during the summer.\n Andalusia: This southern region also does not expect to lift the alarm state in advance. The regional government today advises all municipal governments in the region not to hold festive fairs and celebrations in July and August, but the region spoke People said that the final decision is in the hands of the municipalities. The spokesperson said: The regional government insists on not holding such celebrations in July and August. We also need to understand how the epidemic evolves and whether it can be This celebration is held in January, but it is still too early to observe until mid-August.\n Catalonia: the second most severe epidemic region, contrary to Madrid, this region has applied for the Barcelona metropolitan area and Lleida province to enter the final epidemic downgrade phase 3 from this Thursday. The Spanish Ministry of Health will work with Canada tomorrow The leaders of the government of Catalonia held a video conference to decide whether to agree to Barcelona and Lleida entering phase 3 before the alarm was lifted. Catalonia's plan is that Catalonia will also be out of the alarm state before next week.\n Southern Murcia: Chairman of the Regional Government and People’s Party, Fernando López Miras, said today that Murcia will welcome the new normal. We have controlled community transmission. He said that there are only 60 active cases in the region, 6 of which are in The general ward and 2 cases were in the UCI intensive care unit. Fernando López Miras also announced that when the Murcia region enters a new normal, the government will mobilize 700 million euros to activate the regional economy, and additional measures include tax cuts of 30 million euros.\n Galicia: The new normal has been in effect since the 15th, but Alberto Nu ez Feijóo, the chairman of the Galician government, reminded today that the risk of possibility may begin on June 21, due to the lifting of alarms throughout Spain State and restoration of national circulation. For this reason, Alberto Nu ez Feijóo said that it is possible for Galicia to issue a movement restriction order from next week to restrict the movement of residents in high-risk areas to Galicia.\n The Spanish government allows regions in Phase 3 to relax some restrictions, such as the capacity for commercial activities. At present, most regions increase the capacity for retail establishments to 75%, allowing the catering industry to consume at bar counters. The government also allows nightlife venues in the districts in Stage 3 to open their doors, but only 30% of passengers and dance floors cannot be used, as this is a place prone to new outbreaks. Only four regions are allowed to open the door, which are Aragón, Cantabria, Extremadura and Castilla La-Mancha.

    "content": "According to a notice from the Zhejiang Provincial Health Commission, a newly diagnosed case, Wu Moumou, male, 36 years old, registered in Wenling City, Taizhou City, has been doing business for a long time in the Beijing Xinfadi Wholesale Market. After returning to Wenling from Beijing, he went to Wenling First People's Hospital for fever, dizziness, sputum and chest tightness and other symptoms, and reported to the local health center. After receiving the report, the First People's Hospital of Wenling City and the local health center immediately reported to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention of Wenling City.

    "content": "There is a group of people who are not policemen, but they always ask questions and follow the clues; they are not doctors and often deal with epidemics; they are not babysitters, but they often have mother-in-law and think about things in detail... they are called the medical profession Sherlock Holmes's epidemiological investigator (hereinafter referred to as the translator).\n Case: Female, X years old, temporarily residing somewhere, with a history of close contact with confirmed cases. Lived somewhere from X month X to X month X, and lived with X and XX during this period; get on the bus from X station at X X X X month X and get off from X station by bus X (wear a mask during the period) …The action track of the diagnosed case of a few hundred words seems to be simple. Behind every time point, place and other details is the hard work of the transfer officer.\n In Huangshi, Hubei, a 15-member Jiangsu-assisted Huangshi Public Health Team assisted the local population in the prevention and control of new coronary pneumonia outbreaks, including elimination, killing, and inspection. Five Musketeers is one of the mobile teams, tracking new cases and clustering outbreaks. They are a group of post-80s from the CDC in Jiangsu Province, namely Chen Yong, Wang Furu, Wu Xiaosong, Tian Ye and Hu Ran.\n Enter the quarantine point, the hot spot, and the case of the confirmed case. Carefully investigate every close contact, every clue, every place involved in the confirmed case, and find out about the living environment, medical experience, daily life, action trajectory, etc... This is their daily work.\n The basic knowledge of clinical medicine, epidemiology, etc. is required to engage in rheology, and the thinking must be flexible, because it is often necessary to speculate and judge based on existing clues. Chen Yong said that the tune is a bit like a police case. The difference is that the police are looking for criminals, and the trafficker is looking for clues to the source of the infection, investigating the contact network behind each confirmed case.\n Chen Yong still remembers that a resident who had received the transfer initially stated that he had never been in contact with any diagnosed patients. When the trafficker inadvertently asked him which room he usually lives in, where his family lives, and how to eat, he basically judged that he had been isolated. Sometimes it seems that casual chat can get key information.\n Are you going to the second aunt's house or the aunt's house to drink wedding wine? A round table or a square table? Do you remember where everyone sits? Who is responsible for cooking? Who will serve the dishes? Who left the seat halfway? Where did I go... Chen Yong restored the tune for the reporter of Half Moon Talk and summed it up as soul torture: Where are you from? Where are you going? Who have you contacted?\n The disease control flow adjuster organizes the boxes after collecting the nasopharyngeal swab specimens\n The transfer officer minimizes the time period for getting confirmed cases on and off the bus to inform citizens taking the same line at the same time to pay attention to self-monitoring and protection. It's not too much to lock their trajectories to every minute. Chen Yong said that how many buses a person (diagnosed case) took on a certain day may be the result of a long time questioned by the traffic controller.\n According to the complexity of the trajectory of the diagnosed case, the degree of coordination and the clarity of memory, etc., the flow time is longer or shorter. Even a tune that can be completed quickly takes two to three hours. Many times you need to keep asking questions. Most things that most people think are not very important are likely to contain very important information. Chen Yong said.\n After completing the inquiries of the individual diagnosed cases, the transfer officer needs to go to each place to conduct a line-by-line investigation according to the clues provided by him, and then to confirm if there are new clues. For confirmed cases with more complicated trajectories, the Five Musketeers will go to different places for readjustment. After each group is completed, the situation will be cross-checked to verify whether the clues provided by the investigator are correct.\n There should be no details when it comes to transfers. Often a resident’s action needs to be split into several parts by the transfer officer for detailed confirmation. It seems that there are some mother-in-law. Think about everything and feel like a nanny. Chen Yong said.\n Chen Yong laughed and said that he was usually a person who didn't talk much, and said the most words since work in 47 days in Huangshi. However, it is necessary to conduct very detailed investigations, including tracing the source of infection and locating close contacts, etc., which directly affect the direction of the epidemic.\n Medical treatment is to remove stock, and disease prevention and control is to control the increase from the source. Only when prevention and control are completed can the pressure on the treatment of downstream cases be reduced. Wang Furu said, how to find the increment depends on the tune.\n With the decrease in the number of confirmed cases of Huangshi New Coronary Pneumonia, the work of the Five Musketeers has also shifted from tracking the source of the confirmed cases to investigating close contacts to the prevention and control of resumption of labor.\n At the time when Huangshi arrived, Chen Yong and his colleagues set off at 7 or 8 in the morning every morning. After returning at 11 or 12 in the evening, they had to do a summary analysis of the day, and could only sleep for four or five hours. At noon, eat chocolate and other stomach pads when you can’t come. Chen Yong said: Very tired, but very down-to-earth. Because the more we run, the faster the hidden danger of the epidemic may be discovered.\n Source: \"Half Moon Talk\", Issue 11, 2020\n Reporter for Half Moon: Qiu Bingqing | Editor: Su Ya\n Editor: Yang Jiannan\n Proofreading: Sun Hao (Intern"

Everyone will do their best to meet the mission of the hospital and complete the task successfully.\n Before leaving, Lan Xiaoxi asked a colleague to cut off her hair for her. Short hair can be more convenient to work, but it is too hasty to start, too late to cut hair, so just cut it. With the determination to fight the epidemic, the long black hair fell, and the gentle Xiao Xi also appeared more courageous and capable.\n In the cheering of the leaders of all the hospitals, the heads of the relevant departments and the staff of the various departments, the 6 team members waved goodbye to everyone and embarked on the road of expedition.\n On June 11, Xuanwu Hospital confirmed the diagnosis promptly, accurately and decisively and reported a new case of new coronavirus pneumonia, which sounded the alarm of Beijing's continued strengthening of epidemic prevention and control. In the past few days, the hospital has operated efficiently, strictly implemented the responsibilities of the Quartet, strictly implemented the strict work requirements of three preventions, four earlys and nines, further tightened regional management, controlled high-risk personnel, strengthened prevention and control of the hospital, and carried out full staff training to ensure the prevention and control measures of the epidemic.

Even though he has been diagnosed, Rice still does not forget to discredit and discredit China. He used the term Wuhan flu in his Facebook post, obviously provoking it deliberately.\n Screenshot of business insider report\n Rice posted on Facebook on the 15th that he and his wife and children were all infected with new coronary pneumonia. His own symptoms were relatively mild, but his son had a high fever and was accompanied by severe cough symptoms. Getting better.\n After Rice was diagnosed, CNN reporter Manu Raju tweeted that Rice did not wear a mask when she attended the House of Representatives meeting on May 28. At that time, he asked him why he didn't wear a mask. The South Carolina Republican representative said that he can maintain a 6-foot social safety distance from other people in Congress without wearing it.\n Figure from Twitter by CNN reporter Raju\n It is worth noting that in her Facebook post, Rice wrote her diagnosis of new coronary pneumonia as a diagnosis of Wuhan flu. In fact, New Coronary Pneumonia is neither flu nor evidence to show that it originated in Wuhan. Rice's so-called Wuhan flu not only exposed his ignorance, but also allowed him to use the epidemic situation to discredit China's attempts to discredit China.\n Picture from Rice Facebook\n Since the outbreak of the epidemic, Trump and many American politicians have repeatedly vilified China, trying to dump the responsibility of the epidemic to China. Rice, like these people, did not forget to make every effort to provoke China even after her diagnosis.\n Business Insider reports pointed out that Rice is the eighth member of the US Congress to date who has been diagnosed or suspected to be infected with new coronary pneumonia. And like President Trump, although many scientific evidences show that wearing masks helps to block the spread of the virus from person to person, many Republican lawmakers have refused to wear masks in public indoor settings.\n In addition, looking at Rice’s social media, he found that he had sent a birthday greeting on June 14th on Trump’s birthday, and was accompanied by two intimate photos with Trump, one of which was almost here.

    "content": "本文由苏宁金融研究院原创，作者为苏宁金融研究院消费金融研究中心主任付一夫\n 北京防疫警报全面拉响！\n 截至6月15日24时，北京本地新增新冠肺炎病例已在5天内破百，而这些病例几乎都有新发地农产品批发市场活动史。当新发地市场的三文鱼案板被检测出新冠病毒后，不少人都将目光投向了三文鱼及其背后的冷链物流。\n 根据现有的研究资料，连肺都没有的三文鱼基本不可能是病毒传播的中间宿主，故而疫情的卷土重来，很有可能是病毒通过冷链从海外传播进来的结果，很多传染病资深专家都给出了这一猜测。正因如此，与冷链物流相关的一系列问题就此成为了疫情之外，各方人士无比关注的焦点。\n 我国冷链物流行业现状如何？又存在哪些漏洞？我们不妨从头说起。\n 一 啥是冷链物流？\n 冷链物流这个名词看似高冷，其实距离你我并不遥远。\n 由于生鲜产品从出厂到运输再到消费者手中，需要消耗较长时间，不利于其保鲜，因此人们想到将冷冻工艺与制冷技术应用至生鲜产品的物流过程，以此来确保易腐易损产品在生产、贮藏、运输、销售到消费前的各个环节，始终处于特定的低温环境，从而保证质量、减少损耗。这便是所谓的冷链物流，多应用于食品、农产品、快消品与医药领域（见图1）。\n 举个通俗点的例子，如果一骑红尘妃子笑，无人知是荔枝来的故事发生在今天，那么为了让杨贵妃能吃到宛如刚从树上摘下来的新鲜荔枝，大概要采取这样的方式来运输荔枝：\n 先是有专门的冷藏设备设计和制造商，为荔枝运输提供技术保障与配套设施，比如冷藏车生产、冷机制造等等；再要经过干线运输、冷库运营与城市配送等环节的相互配合，以此来确保荔枝在流通中始终处于低温环境之中，直到送达杨贵妃手中。\n 而这便是现代冷链物流大体上的全部过程（见图2）。\n 本质上讲，冷链物流还是物流，其核心目的自然是保障生鲜、快消品以及医药行业等特殊商品的品质，并保证货物运输的时效性。\n 可是，既然名字里多了高大上的冷链字样，冷链物流自然拥有一些与众不同的特征，主要有二：\n 冷链物流中的产品在流通的过程中需要遵守3T 原则（即Time流通时间、Temperature贮藏温度和Tolerance产品耐藏性）。由于这些产品的品质会随着温度与时间的变化而变化，因此不同种类的产品都必须要有各自对应的温度控制和储藏时间，且要求运输者必须追踪监督商品的整个流通过程，这便极大地增加了冷链物流的复杂性。\n 通常来说，需要用冷链进行运输的产品都要求时效和温度，同时在运输的每个环节也对温度和湿度都有较高要求，运输条件堪称苛刻。不仅如此，生鲜与其他易腐产品还需要特定的运输设备、温控设备、保鲜设备和储存设备，每一样设备都是价格不菲，这些都大大抬高了冷链物流的各方面成本。\n 至此，冷链物流的大致轮廓已呈现在各位眼前。\n 二 冷链物流缘何被重视？\n 长期以来，由于投入门槛高、运营成本贵、回报周期长等与生俱来的行业属性，冷链物流一直不温不火，2016年冷链物流收入甚至不到社会物流业总收入的3%。\n 然而，最近几年，冷链物流却摇身一变成为香饽饽，不仅各路商家竞相热捧，就连国家都多次发布政策文件对冷链物流予以支持，诸如顺应现代流通模式发展趋势，加快冷链物流创新发展、加快建设以冷藏盒低温仓储运输为主的农产品冷链系统一类的字样更是被频频提及。\n 是什么让冷链物流越来越被各界所重视？在我看来，原因有三：\n 根据国际惯例，人均GDP达到1万美元左右时，消费需求增长将从生存型、数量型向发展型、享受型转变。2018年我国人均GDP为9771美元，2019年则突破1万美元，标志着国人已进入消费升级的重要窗口期，反映到食品上，就是人们对于质量、营养、口感、安全等方面的价值日益重视。\n 低温食品售价虽然偏高，但一般保质期更短，口感相应更佳、营养也相对更丰富，是当前消费升级的重要方向，冷鲜肉、低温奶等商品的备受欢迎就是佐证；而低温食品在储存、运输、销售过程中需要全程冷链，那么其需求的蓬勃增长自然就带火了冷链物流。\n 以冷鲜肉为例，冷鲜肉又称排酸肉，在冷链环境下经历了较充分的解僵成熟过程（加工、流通和零售过程中始终保持在0~4℃），微生物繁殖受到抑制，肉质细嫩，滋味更加鲜美；反观热鲜肉这种最传统的市售猪肉，多为半夜屠宰、清晨供应上市的新鲜肉，其生产简单易行，但口感和风味较差，食品安全同样难以保证。\n 受需求端消费升级、互联网的大发展与便利生活趋势的影响，整个零售行业也开始自我革新，生鲜电商便是因此而得以蹿红。\n 由于生鲜购买为高频次的即时性消费，故而消费者对生鲜送达的时效性和新鲜度提出高要求，不断考验生鲜零售商的物流水平。而根据平安证券的研究报告，生鲜电商冷链物流成本占比达到了20%~40%，若是某一家能在冷链部分有实质性的突破，必然会与竞争对手拉开差距。正因如此，以盒马鲜生、苏鲜生、每日优鲜等为代表的生鲜电商巨头们都开始重金投入自建冷链体系，并极大地推动了冷链物流行业的发展。\n 2016年3月，山东省数亿元疫苗未冷藏流入18省的消息霸屏朋友圈，事件的不断发酵引发了国民对疫苗与其他药品运输的高度关注，而其中的破题关键恰恰在于冷链，该事件的深远影响也在相当程度上倒逼着冷链物流的发展。\n 虽说我国冷链物流行业正在快速发展，但与发达国家相比，我国人均冷库容量、冷链流通率以及农产品冷藏运输率等多项关键指标仍有显著差距，冷链基础设施不完备叠加生鲜产品自身保质期短、易损坏等特点，使其在层层流转中产生较高的损耗率，其中果蔬、肉类、水产品损耗率远超发达国家平均水平（见图3）。\n 不过，差距的存在也说明潜力的巨大，在国家政策支持、居民消费升级、行业不断进化的综合影响下，预计我国冷链物流将迎来一个高速增长的黄金期。\n 三 冷链物流的漏洞有哪些？\n 可即便如此，冷链物流中存在的种种问题依然不容忽视。此次北京新冠肺炎疫情的反弹，又再度提醒了所有人：冷链物流运输过程中的漏洞亟需尽快补上，否则必定是后患无穷。\n 总结起来，冷链物流共有三大痛点：\n 尽管我国先后出台了《食品冷链物流追溯管理要求》《冷链物流分类与基本要求》等冷链物流标准，但这些标准大多为推荐性参考标准，缺乏强制力。\n 对于生鲜农产品行业来说，由于流通环节众多，流通标准要求较高，在缺乏行业标准和有效监督的情况下，产品品质很难得到保证。即使部分平台会提供食品溯源服务，在经过复杂的流通环节后，也无法确保食品安全。更有甚者，很多企业表面打着全程冷链的旗号，实际上为了节省物流成本，运用敞篷车运送低温物品或进行间歇式供冷，在运送途中关掉冷冻设备。\n 这绝非少数现象，不仅会大大降低食品质量，还会给我国食品安全问题埋下隐患，北京新发地市场上的三文鱼案板上检测出新冠病毒，或许也能由此得到解释。\n 生鲜农产品在运输过程中需要各个环节的密切配合，这就在客观上要求更为全面系统的基础设施建设。然而，我国食品冷链体系建设进程较为缓慢，直接制约了冷链流通率的提高。\n 例如在运输环节，据统计我国约有13.4万辆冷藏车，仅占货运汽车的0.3%；且由于质量检验标准缺失，资源利用率低，导致专业的冷链运输设备利用率并不高。同时，市面上还存在许多非法改装冷藏车的现象，这又给食品安全带来了挑战。此外，冷链食品在配送过程中信息化程度低，缺乏系统化、规范化、连贯性的运作，信息多靠人工传递，效率低下，断链现象颇为严重，极大地限制了冷链系统的及时性。\n 再如装卸环节，相当一部分企业依然采用人工搬运的传统方式，机械化水平偏低，既浪费了人力资源，又会因为在装卸过程中无法保持低温而造成食品的腐败。\n 冷链系统的建设和操作对专业化要求很高，需要由专业的人才来完成，大体包括技术型人才、信息型人才和管理型人才三大类。然而有数据显示，目前全国每年从全日制物流专业毕业的人数大约有20万，但物流人才的缺口高达130万，供不应求之势极度明显。这当中，专业冷链物流人才供给的形势更为严峻，很多企业员工都缺乏对冷链物流技术的深入认识，很大程度上影响了冷链物流的发展。\n 这些痛点，也指明了接下来我国冷链物流行业需要努力的方向。\n 四 结语\n 疫情的反复无常，相信任何人都不愿意看到。\n 好消息是，在发现新增病例的第一时间，北京就做出了迅速的反应，并且在信息通报上做到及时透明，各项防控措施也都执行得到位且彻底。更何况几个月下来，我们在防控新冠疫情上已经积累了丰富的经验，我们有足够的底气和信心再次战胜新冠病毒。\n 不过，冷链漏洞导致病毒输入的可能性，仍然值得行业去反思。\n 关于疫情倒逼产业升级的故事，我们已经见得太多太多。或许对于冷链物流来说，这也是一个全新的发展契机。\n 吃一堑长一智，衷心希望，类似的情况不要再次发生"

    "title": "Trump withdrew 10,000 times from the WHO, and he could not get rid of the pot of \"incompetence against the epidemic and export of the epidemic situation\"!",
    "content": "On the evening of May 18th, US President Trump threatened WHO Director-General Tan Desai, if he did not obey and make substantial improvements within 30 days, the United States would terminate the payment of dues and reconsider whether to stay in the organization. However, 10 days later, at the White House press conference on the 29th, Trump officially announced that the United States would terminate its relationship with WHO on the grounds that WHO refused to implement the US request. In a hurry to leave the group, in addition to being anxious and angry, what other abacus Trump did?\n Faced with the new global pneumonia epidemic, the world’s biggest challenge since World War II, WHO has not known how many early warning reminders. Most countries have chosen to work closely together to fight for victory while they are struggling to fight the epidemic. It is only the United States that fights against epidemic delays, organizational chaos, unjustified accusations of cooperation, and continued destruction, causing the world's largest power to become the epicenter of the epidemic. According to the latest statistics released by Johns Hopkins University on the 30th, there are more than 6 million confirmed cases of new coronary pneumonia in the world, including 1.76 million cases in the United States, accounting for almost one third.\n Today's situation is not so much a natural disaster as a human disaster. From deafness in the early stage to inaction in the later stage, the epidemic has been accelerated objectively. As reported by the British \"Guardian\", epidemiological experts estimate that 90% of the dead in the first outbreak in the United States should not have lost their lives.\n The responsibility of the United States for the spread of the world's epidemic also lies in the accelerated repatriation of illegal immigrants at special times to export the epidemic to the world. Since the declaration of a national emergency in mid-March, Trump has stepped up the repatriation of illegal immigrants from Latin American countries such as Mexico on the grounds of prevention and control of the epidemic. Despite frequent confirmed cases in illegal immigration detention centers in the United States, and despite the widespread condemnation of the United States’ actions for putting the world at risk, the United States still insists on acting alone, even repatriating immigrants to Latin American countries in large numbers without testing. The weak local health and safety system brings additional pressure and risks.\n Take Guatemala as an example. A total of 119 immigrants repatriated from the United States have been diagnosed with the new coronavirus, and the number of infected repatriated persons once accounted for 15% of the total number of confirmed cases in the country. No wonder Guatemalan President Jama too bluntly questioned, how can the United States do something like an ally?\n According to the official report of the US Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, as of May 23, a total of 25,911 illegal immigrants were detained in illegal immigration detention centers in the United States, of which only one-tenth had been tested by the new crown virus, and the infection rate was as high as 52%. According to a Guatemalan who once lived in the immigration center, more than 200 people live in a large room in the immigration center. Everyone shared the bathroom and toilet, so many people could only sleep on the ground, the staff did not give us a piece of hand soap, let alone disinfectant. The repatriation of immigrants from this viral petri dish is an obvious disaster to the world.\n Currently, there have been confirmed cases of repatriated persons in Haiti, Jamaica, Colombia and other countries. According to the US Center for Economic and Policy Research, the US Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement confirmed to it that between March 8 and May 9, the United States arranged a total of 111 repatriation flights to repatriate immigrants to 12 Latin American and Caribbean countries. The center believes that the large-scale repatriation of migrants under the epidemic is sending the virus to countries with weak health systems. It is not difficult to think that the US epidemic situation is so out of control, how many viruses are exported on flights from the United States to all continents and countries in the world?\n The domestic anti-epidemic is in a complete mess, and the epidemic situation is continuously exported to the outside world. However, in the face of condemnation and doubt at home and abroad, the US government tried to blur the focus by dumping China or the World Health Organization again and again. From this perspective, Trump's abrupt withdrawal from the WHO is not only to evade current responsibilities and pass on guilt, but also to deepen the level. I am afraid that he will lay the groundwork for refusing international investigations in the future.\n You can't take a flashlight and just take photos of others but not yourself. The fact that the new crown epidemic spreads is there, as is the responsibility of the US government. The world is tired of shirk its responsibilities and confuse the audio-visual system. If this continues, it will only further erode the credibility of the United States and make the image of the lighthouse disappear.\n Editor: Hu Yuqi\n Process editor: Wu"

However, the United States did not mention the resolution of the World Health Assembly entitled Covid-19 Response, and made many reservations about the resolution itself. what opinions do the Chinese have on this issue?\n In response, Hua Chunying said that everyone knows that the 73rd World Health Assembly adopted a resolution on the response to the new coronary pneumonia epidemic by consensus on May 19, which clearly recognizes and supports WHO’s key leadership role , Urged Member States to prevent discrimination and stigmatization, combat false and false information, strengthen cooperation in research and development of diagnostic tools, diagnostic methods, drugs and vaccines, and sources of viral animals, and evaluate WHO and respond to outbreaks in due course.\n Hua Chunying pointed out that China, together with 144 countries, is a co-sponsor of the draft resolution. However, a few countries such as the United States did not participate in the co-sponsoring of the resolution. The United States also spoke when the resolution was adopted by the General Assembly and made a decision on the content of the resolution. Many reservations. The United States is now showing a very positive and enthusiastic attitude, which fully shows the double standards that the United States applies to multilateral institutions and international consensus, and disagrees.\n Hua Chunying said that China will continue to work with the vast majority of countries in the international community to firmly support the work of WHO. China has always been open to the international scientific community's cooperation in virus tracing research and supports the principle of professionalism, fairness and constructiveness. Under the leadership of WHO, scientists and medical experts are allowed to conduct investigations on a global scale. Research in order to improve the scientific understanding of such viruses, better respond to major infectious diseases in the future, and improve the global public health system and governance capabilities.\n Considering that the United States is currently the country with the worst epidemic in the world, we call on the United States to strengthen cooperation with WHO for the safety and health of its people and world public health, and invite or agree to arrange for WHO experts to When he went to the United States to conduct an investigation, Hua Chunying said that he also gave an explanation to the concerns of the international community"

    "content": "Although more than 2.11 million deaths were confirmed in the United States and more than 116,000 deaths, on Monday, local time, Trump continued to downplay concerns about the increasing number of coronavirus cases in various states in the United States, saying that the increase in cases was due to more testing.\n Trump emphasized the government's actions to help the elderly at an event in the White House. He said that if we stop testing now, even if there are cases, there will be very few.\n Trump often makes inconsistent comments on the test. He sometimes tried to downplay the severity of the coronavirus pandemic, saying that the United States has more people tested than any other country, so the number of confirmed cases is also higher. At other times, Trump complained that the positive rate and case count were too high because too many people were tested in this country.\n Trump’s dual views on detection are fully reflected on Monday morning’s Twitter. Our tests are larger and more advanced than any other country (we’ve done a good job in this area!) If there is no test, or weak Test, we will show almost no cases. Testing is a double-edged sword-it makes us look terrible, but it is a good thing to have it!! Trump said so.\n Vice President Pence made a similar comment on Monday, suggesting that the White House has shifted its focus from addressing the health effects of the virus to holding election rallies and reopening states as soon as possible.\n The Trump administration has stated that, given that the closure of the United States has caused damage to the economy, it has no interest in a series of blockades by the United States. Since the White House ended its daily coronavirus briefing in April, White House health officials, such as the White House Coronavirus Working Group coordinators Deborah and Foch, have played a much smaller role in the public.\n During the election year in the United States, the virus pandemic hit the United States, and Trump's popular approval rating declined during the crisis.\n Pence said that although health experts have warned about possible outbreaks in Texas, Florida, Arizona, Alabama, Oklahoma and Arkansas, the United States has spread coronavirus to more and more people in the past Steady progress has been made in areas farther away. Pence said the surge may be due to a substantial increase in testing.\n In addition, data analyzed by the New York Times show that in the past week, coronavirus cases have surged in 20 US states. These numbers may be misleading because some states are also increasing the number of people who are tested. However, the number of daily tests declined in some states, despite the increase in average new cases over 7 days. In other states, the rate of new cases is growing faster than the average number of tests.\n In all tests, the percentage of positive test results is also rising, which means that despite the reopening of the states, the virus has not been controlled.\n The number of coronavirus cases diagnosed in US states has increased dramatically, prompting some local elected officials to consider suspending the reopening of the economy.\n The increasing number of cases has hit the Sunshine Belt states such as Arizona, California, Florida and Texas the hardest, and all four states have reported the highest single-day increase in the number of confirmed cases over the weekend.\n Local officials also pointed out that there is a disturbing trend in the number of people who must be hospitalized for treatment, which once again triggered the terrible prospects of the overwhelmed health system. Arizona’s chief public health official last week called on the state’s hospital system to start their emergency plan.\n A county judge in Harris County, Texas told reporters on Thursday that if the trend we are seeing now becomes worse or continues to rise, we are facing very high risks and our hospital system will face serious threats.

This is one of the worst reactions ever recorded. Our response is one of the best. The rapid action to close the border has achieved a 78% approval rating, the highest ever recorded. His is the lowest!\n Three days after the tweet on March 13, when only 676 Americans died of the new crown virus, Trump told his Twitter fans that 17,000 Americans would die, with an estimated death toll between 8,300 and 18,300 Between people.\n Trump wrote: Just look at the disaster of the H1N1 epidemic. When Biden came to power and killed 17,000 people, he responded very late.\n On April 17, the number of deaths in the new U.S. Coronary Pneumonia reached 30915, but this did not prevent Trump from comparing it with the way Biden and Obama dealt with the previous outbreak.\n Biden and Obama were a disaster when dealing with the H1N1 outbreak. The opinion polls at the time showed that the approval rating was disastrous. Seventeen thousand people died of unnecessary incompetence! In addition, don’t forget their $5 billion Obamacare website, which shouldn’t cost money! Trump said on April 17.\n Unlike Vice President Mike Pence, Biden played a less obvious role in the Obama administration’s response to the H1N1 outbreak, and Trump gave him responsibility for leading the government’s response to the coronavirus pandemic.\n Nonetheless, this did not stop Obama from touting the former vice president’s experience in handling public health crises. When Obama supported Biden's campaign for president on April 14, he said: Joe helped me control the H1N1 outbreak and prevented the Ebola outbreak from becoming the kind of pandemic we see now.\n The H1N1 outbreak has infected 60 million people in the United States. So far, more than 1.69 million Americans have tested positive for the new coronavirus, indicating that the mortality rate is much higher.\n Trump has always focused on comparing the respective death tolls and his claims about his popularity. Although it is unclear that Trump claimed he received 78% approval for the epidemic’s handling, a Gallup daily follow-up poll conducted in February found that 77% of Americans have the federal government’s ability to handle the epidemic Have confidence. However, this poll was conducted under the circumstances that the number of deaths in the United States can be counted with one hand.\n ABC News and an opinion survey released last week by Ipsos found that 39% of Americans agree with Trump's response to the new coronary pneumonia epidemic, while 60% disagree.\n A poll conducted by Gallup early in the outbreak of the H1N1 outbreak found that 66% of Americans agreed with the Obama administration's approach. What do you think of this"

    "content": "Source: Overseas Network\n James Selmon's company was forced to close in the new crown pandemic. (Pictured in CBSNews video)\n Selmon is a black American female business owner. She owns an event planning company in Minneapolis for more than 4 years and employs more than a dozen employees. At the beginning of this year, she was ambitious to improve wedding and birthday party planning services. However, in less than four months, her company, like black business owners across the United States, was permanently closed during the New Crown Epidemic.\n After Minnesota closed down non-essential employers in March, a customer called Selmont to cancel the order, which cost her $120,000 (approximately RMB 847,000). The 42-year-old Selmont said that with more industries closed, all wedding planning orders in May, June and July were cancelled. Selmon said that dismissal of employees is really difficult. The sacked female employees are crying and the rest of the employees are sad.\n CBS News reported that nearly half of black companies in the United States have been permanently closed during the epidemic. The report quoted estimates from the US Census survey that as of early February this year, there were more than 1 million black business owners across the United States. By mid-April, more than 440,000 black business owners had permanently closed the company—a plunge rate of 41%. In contrast, research from the University of California, Santa Cruz showed that 17% of white companies closed during the same period.\n There are several reasons why black companies have not survived the epidemic. Perhaps most importantly, many black companies are unable to obtain bank credit, which makes their survival in financial emergencies more difficult. Many black businesses are micro-enterprises that can only provide livelihoods for self-employed persons or a few employees. Corporate profit margins are very low, and owners’ financial savings are usually small, so they are susceptible to sudden profit declines.\n The investigation also revealed that during the outbreak the authorities refused to provide loans to the vast majority of black business owners. Selmon said she applied for a loan of US$50,000 (about 353,000 yuan) shortly after the start of the salary protection plan, but before the loan was approved, the funds were exhausted. The analysis in charge of the loan center found that 95% of black companies were excluded from the plan. Many state government officials see loans to black companies as non-essential services, which has caused devastating blows to black companies.\n The report pointed out that the collapse of so many black companies this year also highlights the legacy of American racism. According to data from the Federal Reserve, black companies have historically refused loans more than any other race. As a result, many African-Americans doing business avoid banks altogether.\n In addition, Robert Fairlie, a professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz, pointed out that the huge gap between the rich and the poor between blacks and whites also makes the black companies face huge obstacles to revitalize their businesses after the pandemic has eased. Fairley said that many African-American families lack the financial resources (such as bank savings) needed to rebuild, and lack the ability to obtain home equity credit lines or borrow money from family and friends.\n Therefore, Fairly suggested that in order to avoid more black companies from getting into trouble, the US federal government can help black companies through difficult times by providing special small business loans. These loans can be exempted from salary or income requirements, for example, from those conditions that must be met in order to obtain a salary protection plan loan.

Recently, its campaign team said it would be great to hold another event in Tulsa, Oklahoma. However, some American media noticed that in the event registration information issued by their team on the 11th, the people must agree to an exemption clause when filling out: if they are infected with the new crown virus during the campaign, they cannot sue the campaign team.\n Politico, an American political news website, reported that Trump’s campaign rally usually had thousands of supporters gathered in the venue for hours. On the registration page, there is a short disclaimer on the registration icon: click on the registration below to indicate that you have known that there is a risk of exposure to the new corona virus in participating in aggregate activities in public places.\n The statement went on to say that as long as they participate in the rally, the attendees and guests voluntarily assume any risk of exposure to the new coronavirus and agree not to be held accountable to the campaign team, venue or other relevant parties for illness or injury.\n Not only that, this registration page does not mention any content or other security measures related to social isolation regulations, nor does it include the recommendation of the US Centers for Disease Control to wear masks in specific places. Politico pointed out that because the US epidemic has not yet been effectively controlled, Trump's decision to resume the campaign has caused great controversy in the United States, with support and opposition voices coming and going. However, the US media pointed out that this decision is likely related to Trump's recent poll performance.\n On the other hand, there has been a surge in confirmed cases of new coronary pneumonia in multiple states in the United States, and protests and demonstrations are still continuing, but many governors have already begun plans to restart the economy. Politico said that Oklahoma had seen an increase in the number of confirmed cases in early June, but local health officials said that the increase was within their estimates and the state could continue to restart.

The American leader led by Trump chose to send the American police to force the violence, and even sent US active duty troops, which was a big blow. The image of the United States in the world has also greatly damaged the pride of Americans, and the new crown epidemic is still spreading in the United States, and the number of diagnoses and deaths in the world is the first in the world. A new Gallup investigation found that Americans’ pride in the United States has fallen to a record level during the domestic turmoil caused by the coronavirus pandemic and police shooting George Floyd The lowest point.\n Comprehensive US media news on June 15, most American adults (63%) still said that they are extremely or very proud that they are American.

The proportion of those who are extremely proud of being Americans has been steadily declining, and has reached new lows in the past six years.\n Burying the dead island\n Historically, Republicans are more likely than Democrats or nonpartisans to say they are extremely proud of being American.

Gallup polls show that Trump’s job approval rate is 39%, close to the lowest level in history"

    "content": "[Southern + June 16th] According to US media reports, on June 15, President Trump once again downplayed concerns about the rise in the number of confirmed cases of new coronavirus in US states, saying that the increase in cases is due to more testing.\n Trump emphasized at an event in the White House: If we stop testing now, we will have very few cases.\n Trump often makes inconsistent comments about the new crown virus test. He often tries to downplay the severity of the epidemic, saying that the United States has more people tested than any other country, so the number of confirmed cases is greater.\n Trump's dual views on detection were fully reflected in the Twitter on the morning of the 15th. Trump said on Twitter: Our testing is much more than any other country, and more advanced (we are doing very well in this regard!), so we will have more cases. If there is no testing, or reduce testing, we will almost never have cases. Detection is a double-edged sword-it makes us look bad, but it's actually good! ! !\n US Vice President Pence also made a similar remark on the 15th, suggesting that the White House has shifted its focus from addressing the health effects of the new coronavirus to holding election rallies and reopening the states as soon as possible.\n The Trump administration declared that in view of the economic losses caused by the blockade to the country, they have no interest in a new round of blockades in the United States.\n Trump's remarks promptly caused heated discussions on Twitter. Some netizens denounced Trump: baby logic! Another Twitter user pointed out: If we stop investigating murders, there will be very few murders in the United States. Immediately after a user pointed out that if a woman did not receive a pregnancy test, they would not be pregnant. Then another netizen teased: Well, then the cure for cancer is to stop testing. Some netizens even scolded directly: the dumbest president ever! Another netizen made a vomiting expression and wrote: He is so stupid, it really makes me a headache. When I had to listen to his mean voice, I wanted to vomit!\n The report said that since the White House’s New Crown Virus briefing ended in April, the number of government health officials such as the White House’s New Crown Virus Special Task Force expert Fuch has appeared in the public’s public space.\n According to data analyzed by the New York Times, the number of new coronavirus cases in 20 US states has surged in the past week.\n Source|Southern+Client\n Proofreading: Li Guan"

    "content": "Today, let’s talk about the topic of a sudden outbreak in 2020. For the re-election of current US President Donald Trump, is it more good than bad, or more bad than good? In short, this outbreak For Trump, what does it mean and how much influence does it have on him?\n First of all, the editor believes that this epidemic is an unpredictable hard battle for Trump, and it is also a hard battle that Trump has to fight. At the same time, it is also an exam for Trump, an exam that has to be tested. In fact, it is not just Trump, countries around the world are facing situations that have to be dealt with. The disease spreads rapidly, countless people's lives and health are threatened, and many people lose their lives as a result. In addition, there are many white angels sacrificed for this. In addition, the epidemic has caused countless enterprises and factories to go bankrupt, making countless people unemployed and wandering the streets.\n As the President of the United States, Trump is not prepared. This is manifested in his initial advocacy that the epidemic was nothing but a new scam by the Democratic Party, but a big cold, and it was no big deal. It is precisely under this kind of ideological guidance that Trump did not make enough preparations, nor did he give enough reminders to the people. As a result, the result is that there have been many epicenters in the United States. The United States has become the world’s first country with confirmed cases. As of May 29, there were 1,717,756 new cases of new pneumonia and a total of 101,470 deaths. Ranked first in the world.\n In this sense, Trump is guilty. Not only did he waste the time saved by the great powers of the East, but he also frequently dumped the pot and accused other countries and parties. In short, the problems were caused by other people, and he No problem at all. On the contrary, he also dressed himself as a wartime president, meaning that he was on par with Roosevelt. Speaking of which, we have to say that as the oldest president of the United States, Trump has always been committed to building his own image of a political strongman. In fact, he did. This is also the reason why his support rate was not low during the epidemic.\n Next, he will have a final battle with Biden for the next American president. The editor wants to say that this epidemic may be harmful to Trump. Because of his performance during the epidemic, it is really not convincing. What do you think of this? Do you like Biden to win?

    "content": "Early this morning (June 17), the full screen was full of news that Beijing's emergency response level was raised from level 3 to level 2. This news not only affected the hearts of the people of Beijing, but also the hearts of the people of the whole country, and even attracted the attention of the world.\n The Beijing Municipal Epidemic Prevention and Control Press Conference held yesterday evening was postponed until very late. From the time when the press conference was held, we can see the urgency of the parties involved in collecting the latest information, making decisions based on it, and linking up their releases. Beijing's emergency response level will be raised from level three to level two, which will undoubtedly bring changes to Beijing's work and life rhythm, and will also have an impact on places and personnel with various connections to Beijing. However, before the outbreaks of New Coronavirus, New Coronary Pneumonia, and New Coronary Pneumonia can be clearly explained scientifically, the change in emergency response level is one of the so-called normalization of normalized epidemic prevention and control.\n The new outbreak in Beijing has just emerged, and the World Health Organization (WHO) has listed it as a major event at its response level. The WHO said that although there have been no deaths in Beijing's new epidemic so far, the epidemic is still worrying considering the size of Beijing's cities, the scale of personnel movement and the density of contacts. Regarding why the large number of new cases of new pneumonia that occur in some countries and cities every day is not classified as a major event, and the small number of new cases in Beijing is classified as a major event, WHO explained that Beijing has no new cases in more than 50 days. In this case, the new epidemic in Beijing is a major event. WHO takes the new epidemic in Beijing very seriously and needs to trace the source. In fact, Beijing's emergency response level has been raised from level 3 to level 2, which is based on the same reason as WHO's concerns.\n Interestingly, the WHO stated that the new coronavirus was detected on the cutting board that cut imported salmon. The claim that the imported salmon or its packaging may spread (virus) is a hypothesis and needs more verification. The process of the new outbreak in Beijing is the issue that people are most concerned about. If the epidemiology is clear about the propagation path and mechanism of the new coronavirus, the prevention and control resources can be concentrated, and the prevention and control will be more targeted. The key and even the precise prevention and control will have a basis, and the prevention and control can achieve a multiplier effect. .\n Whether the new outbreak in Beijing is transmitted locally or imported abroad requires more detailed research. After the outbreak of the New Coronary Pneumonia epidemic, the South China seafood market in Wuhan, which was initially associated with the epidemic, was quickly eliminated and closed, making local epidemiological investigations untraceable. Not only Wuhan, but many countries with epidemic conditions have not traced, tracked and monitored the epidemic conditions. The new place of occurrence associated with the new outbreak in Beijing is not only Beijing’s vegetable baskets and fruit dishes, but also links with five provinces in North China and three provinces in Northeast China, as well as all parts of the South to Hainan. A thorough investigation of epidemiology is a very necessary thing.\n Earlier media reports said that on June 15th, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention has completed the determination and analysis of the whole genome sequence of the virus in the relevant case samples of the new outbreak in Beijing. The preliminary conclusions have been reported and virus tracing is being actively carried out"

    "content": "Yesterday afternoon, the medical staff of Cui Gezhuang Community Health Service Center in Chaoyang District came to the fifth district of Jingwang home again to conduct nucleic acid detection on the residents here. Since 23:00 on June 12th, when resident Wang Mou was diagnosed as asymptomatically infected with new coronary pneumonia during a business trip in Shenyang, the five districts of Jingwang homeland have completed a total of 1,120 in accordance with the principle of due diligence and willingness Residents' nucleic acid testing.\n Preparation: Social workers are present to check the codes in advance\n At two o'clock in the afternoon, the blazing sun was at the head. Medical staff from Cui Gezhuang Community Health Service Center wearing protective clothing, goggles or protective screen, together with the staff of Beijing Jinyu Medical Laboratory, appeared on time on the south side of Building 13, District 5, Jingwang Small park. Although the community has coordinated the property to set up awnings on the open space in advance, the hot sun still makes the ground hot. Before the test started, their hair was soaked in sweat.\n Also sweating was the social worker who arrived at the site an hour ago and started working. In order to improve efficiency, shorten the waiting time of residents, and reduce the burden of medical staff, we move our work forward as much as possible. Zang Yongchun, secretary of the Party Committee of the Second Community of Jingwang Homeland, said that social workers are responsible for checking personnel and attaching barcodes to kits and sample tables. Residents only need to hold the kit and go to the medical staff for testing. Four groups, one of which is used as a substitute, because the weather is too hot, for safety reasons, shifts must be arranged in the middle.\n At 23 o'clock on June 12, Wang Moumou, a resident of the fifth district of Jingwang's home, was diagnosed with asymptomatic infection of new coronary pneumonia during a business trip in Shenyang, and was subsequently diagnosed. According to the relevant epidemic prevention and control regulations, the relevant departments will conduct 14-day closed management, regular killing and elevator suspension for the unit where the case resides, and conduct quarantine observation on their families and unit residents.\n On the morning of the 13th, two groups of medical personnel conducted nucleic acid detection on the 21 residents of the isolation unit, so that they should be exhaustively checked, and one was not missed. After the medical staff inspected, the entourage immediately killed the scene. Zang Yongchun said that at around 1:30 in the afternoon, the household inspection was announced, and a wider range of inspections were launched.\n Sampling: batch sampling according to buildings is currently negative\n The township government coordinated professional organizations to conduct free nucleic acid testing for residents in the five districts of Jingwang's homeland in accordance with the principle of'willing to check and check.' Zang Yongchun said that there are 11 buildings in the five districts with as many as 3,992 residents. In order to avoid people gathering, the community decided to collect pharyngeal swab samples in batches from building to building from 2 to 5 in the afternoon from Monday to Wednesday. The location was selected in a relatively open and well-ventilated small park in the community. The community posted notices in each building in advance, and sent notifications through the WeChat group of the handheld quadrangle in each building. Residents who need to be tested only need to bring their ID cards and the five-zone access card and be present at the site within a specified time.\n In addition, the frontline staff of the community and the property also deliberately rushed to the detection point near Ditan Hospital on Sunday to perform nucleic acid testing to ensure that the results are negative, and then serve the residents, so that residents can rest assured that they are also responsible for the residents.\n Zang Yongchun found that although the task of nucleic acid detection was heavy, the order on the spot was orderly. For the residents, after a real turn, they would sit there and open their mouths to take samples, which could be completed soon. And to be so smooth, a lot of tedious preparations are indispensable. We must prepare the residents' roster in advance, and then put the third-party nucleic acid test sample collection information table in place. In order to complete these tasks, Zang Yongchun and his colleagues worked overtime until late at night for several consecutive days. At the latest, they were busy until two o'clock in the morning, and then went to work at 7:30 the next morning.\n Despite the hard work, Zang Yongchun was very pleased, the residents were very cooperative, and the township government also made every effort to ensure that the frontline workers in the community were equipped with professional protective materials to ensure everyone's safety. Zang Yongchun said that after three days of centralized testing, the list of residents and wishes will be combined to see if more testing needs to be arranged. At present, the test results are negative, so everyone is more confident.\n Source: Beijing Daily Client | Reporter Zong Yuanyuan\n Editor: Xu Huiyao\n Process editor: Guo"

At that time, the attention of these two games will be very high, and the focus of the outside world will be all-round. .\n In other aspects, the Premier League and the first Bundesliga to start the game are similar. Originally the Premier League looked forward to a rematch in the Chinese position, but under the strong demands of the clubs, it became an empty field home.\n In addition, the team can stay in the hotel, but do not need to be isolated in the hotel like the Bundesliga. As long as the social distance is guaranteed, players can still travel freely. Previously, the Bundesliga coach of Augsburg was suspended for going out to the supermarket to buy toothpaste. Such a situation will not appear in the Premier League.\n However, the Premier League officials also stated that they would impose heavy penalties for possible violations of relevant epidemic prevention regulations.\n If the relevant person or club violates the regulations twice, Premier League officials can impose a double penalty (400,000 pounds) on them, and they can also impose penalties such as deducting points for the club that violated the regulations.\n Kyle Walker, Foden, Aston Villa's Glalis and Tottenham's Oriya have all violated the relevant isolation regulations.\n All Premier League balls will be disinfected.\n In terms of the number of players in the field, the number of people in the stadium is controlled at about 300 people per game, and the stadium will be divided into 3 access zones-the red zone including the stadium, player channels and locker rooms, with a maximum of 105 People enter.\n As a major broadcaster of the Premier League, Sky Sports will broadcast 64 of the remaining 92 games this season, of which 25 are free live broadcasts, in response to the British government's call to encourage people to watch the game at home to play an important role in maintaining public health. .\n Sky Sports stated that they have tailored different versions of fan sound effects for each team, including yelling and singing, hoping to enhance the fans' viewing experience"

    "content": "[Global Times Special Correspondent in the United States Xue Dan] US President Trump and his campaign team have announced that they will hold a campaign rally in Tulsa County, Oklahoma on the 20th of this month. Trump’s move triggered widespread concerns among health officials, medical experts, and the media when the number of new coronary pneumonia diagnosed in the United States exceeded 2 million, the number of deaths approached 120,000, and the epidemic rebounded in multiple states. Dangerous activity.\n According to US media reports, Trump's first campaign rally will be held indoors. The venue is an arena with 19,000 seats. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention clearly stated in an earlier reminder of new coronary pneumonia that the indoor environment is extremely conducive to the spread of the virus, and Trump’s campaign rally often attracts thousands of supporters. Oklahoma It is the main ticket warehouse of the Republican Party, and the crowded situation on the spot can be predicted. Although there are relatively few cases of New Coronary Pneumonia in Oklahoma, Dr. Bruce Dart, the head of the Tulsa County Health Department in the state, said in an interview with the Tulsa World News that he had difficulty guaranteeing The local has the ability to ensure the health and safety of the people involved in the rally and the president himself. If you want to be safe, don't go. He also hoped that Trump could postpone the date of the election campaign because our cases showed a significant increase.\n Recognizing that there may be risks, the Trump campaign team tried to clear its responsibilities through the disclaimer on its registration website. The website claims that clicking on the registration button means that the registrant acknowledges the inherent risk of exposure to the new coronavirus in any inhabited public place and agrees not to blame Trump and his campaign team for any illness or injury, and Relevant institutions and individuals hosting the rally.\n In response, Dr. Ashish Jia, director of the Harvard Institute of Global Health, said that outdoor parades are less likely to be infected with viruses than crowded activities in enclosed spaces. Therefore, the Trump campaign rally is very dangerous for those who participate in the event and those who may know them or family and friends.\n Affected by the epidemic, the campaign has been stalled for several months, less than half a year before the presidential election. The Associated Press said that Trump has always been eager to resume the most important campaign for him, and that the president enjoys being surrounded by the public. In addition, the rally will help evaluate Trump's political foundation and expand the voter database. Polls show that despite the Democratic presidential candidate Biden's suspension of the campaign due to the epidemic, its approval rating is still ahead of Trump. Therefore, holding a large-scale political rally will be an important opportunity for Trump to boost morale and suppress his opponents."

    "content": "China News Service, Huayu News According to the American Overseas Chinese News, North American Chidao reported that although most states in the United States have not escaped the trouble of the new crown epidemic, President Donald Trump has announced that several will be held this Saturday (20th) The first campaign rally since January. Moreover, the event venue was chosen to be held in an indoor arena with more than 19,000 seats.\n As of the evening of June 14, the number of newly diagnosed cases in the United States has exceeded 2.14 million, including 117,000 deaths.\n According to reports from the Associated Press, this campaign, scheduled for Tulsa, Oklahoma, was originally planned to be held on Friday, June 19, an indoor stadium with more than 19,000 seats. Tickets are already sold out.\n However, this day happened to be the anniversary of slave liberation in the United States. On June 19, 1862, then-President Lincoln signed a law prohibiting slavery. Moreover, in 1921, a serious white mob attacked a black community in the city of Tulsa, causing thousands of black casualties.\n After learning that Trump will start his campaign, African-American communities and religious leaders have criticized the time and place of the campaign chosen by Trump's campaign team.\n To this end, Trump temporarily announced that the rally date will be changed to Saturday, June 20. And said that he did not understand the special meaning of this date to African descent.\n Federal Housing Minister Ben Carson also said that when he proposed the special meaning of the date to the president, Trump was surprised by the relevant information and said that the meeting time might be better if rescheduled.\n The Associated Press reported that people familiar with the matter revealed that Trump's campaign team had some knowledge of the festival when choosing a date a few months ago, but the link between the event location and the 1921 genocide made them Feeling flat-footed. Especially now, the United States is shrouded in protests against police law enforcement against African-American violence.\n In addition, health experts have also questioned Trump's decision to start the campaign, and experts pointed out that indoors are more likely to cause the spread of the new coronavirus than outdoors. This arena has ceased all competition activities since the outbreak.\n CDC experts said: It is difficult to maintain a safe social distance of 6 feet between people at large gatherings, and participants often come from many places. Experts urged people participating in campaign rallies to wear masks.\n As of now, the Trump campaign team has not asked participants to wear masks and other anti-epidemic safety requirements.\n Compared with other parts of the United States, Oklahoma has a relatively low severity of the new crown epidemic. However, the number of new cases in Tulsa is showing an upward trend recently. There were 82 new cases reported on Saturday in the past. The department is investigating whether the surge in cases is related to a large local gathering.\n Tulsa city health officials hope that the president can postpone the election rally. We are honored to have a current president visit, but it would be nice if we could avoid the epidemic period. Bruce Dart, director of the Tulsa City Health Department, said that I am very worried about the people who are going to participate in this large indoor event, and also how to ensure the safety of the president.

    "content": "Source: Overseas Network\n Screenshot of White House Economic Advisor Kudlow (right) interviewed by CNN\n On June 14, local time, Kudlow, director of the US National Economic Commission and White House economic adviser, said in an interview with CNN that he would stop paying unemployed people $600 a week in relief in July. As part of the relief during the epidemic, unemployment benefits are not conducive to people returning to work.\n Kudlow said in the CNN State of the Union Address: The additional relief of $600 played a deterrent role in returning to work. We are spending money to encourage people not to work because they get more money than work. He believes that with the resumption of business activities and the decline in unemployment, the existence of relief is no longer necessary. The US government is studying other incentives, but it will not be as high as it is currently.\n According to reports, at the end of March this year, the United States passed a total of 2.2 trillion US dollars of new pneumonia economic bill, the unemployed can receive an additional 600 US dollars in unemployment benefits per week. Under normal circumstances, the unemployment benefits issued by the states have accounted for 40% of the wages of unemployed workers, plus an additional $600 per week, the income of unemployed workers in the United States is already equivalent to the income at work.\n Facing reporters' questions, many Americans want to return to work, but when the job has not been restored, Kudlow replied: I personally agree with you. I think people want to go back to work. I think they welcome the economic reopening, and they are also eager to go out.\n According to an article in the US \"Huffington Post\", Kudlow's remarks seem to weaken the previous point of view, and contradict people on whether people are eager to work or unwilling to work. Kudlow's attitude towards paying subsidies to people and businesses during the epidemic was in stark contrast. He dismissed the payment of relief to the people, but he supported the use of pardonable public loans to pay high salaries for corporate executives.\n Recently, the US epidemic has shown signs of rebound. After relaxing restrictions on social distances and allowing business restarts, the two most populous states, Texas and Florida, reported the highest number of newly diagnosed cases reported last week. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates on the 12th that by July 4 the number of new coronary pneumonia deaths will reach 140,000.\n The epidemic data released by Johns Hopkins University in the United States shows that as of 6:30 on June 16, Beijing time, a total of 2110182 cases have been diagnosed in the United States and 116081 cases have been died. American infectious disease expert and professor of Vanderbilt University School of Medicine William Schaffner reminded on the 15th that the second wave of new coronary pneumonia in the United States has begun. We are opening up all over the country, but many people do not maintain a social distance, many people do not wear mask. He believes that after the first shock of the first epidemic, it is unthinkable for the US economy to shut down again.

(Picture taken from this website)\n American media reported that a former official in Florida, the United States, was expelled because he opposed the state’s concealment of a large number of cases and data falsification in the release of the new crown epidemic. Later, the former official released the epidemic situation on his own through the establishment of a website to expose the facts related to the concealment of data by the authorities.\n According to a report by CNN on the 15th citing \"Today in Florida\", Rebekah Jones is a former Florida official who was expelled from the project for questioning the credibility and transparency of the reviewed new crown epidemic data released by the state. Last month, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis disputed Jones's claim. The Florida Department of Health (DOH) said she showed a usual disobedience during her tenure. After being expelled, Jones established the Florida Fundraising Action Network (floridacovidaction.com), a public fundraising support website, and said Florida should have a data table based on community statistics that does not hide cases or falsify numbers.\n According to reports, Jones’ website looks very similar to the Florida Department of Health’s website, and also shows the timetable for each county in the state to reopen. However, on the website, Jones compared her data with the new crown epidemic data collected by the Florida Department of Health. The official website of the Florida Department of Health showed much lower numbers.\n Both sites contain data on Florida residents and non-residents, but the overall statistics are very different. According to data from Jones's website, since March 1, the community has reported 83,270 positive cases, including 3,022 deaths. As of Monday (15th) morning, the official website of the State Department of Health reported only 75568 positive cases and 2931 deaths. In the two comparisons, the positive case data counted by Jones is 10.19% higher than the state health department data.\n In this regard, the official website of the Florida Department of Health explained that the Department of Health issued all cases, not positive cases. The Florida Department of Health said it has not yet created cases for patients with positive antibody test results, so the Department of Health excluded them from the total. We show the total number of patients with definite laboratory results, indicating that they have or had suffered from new coronary pneumonia, regardless of the type of test.\n Source: Overseas net of: Hou Xing"

Ali Mukdad, one of the founders of the model, said that there are two main reasons why they have raised their estimates of the estimated number of deaths.

The report pointed out that Trump is trying to downplay the continuous increase of new cases in the US states.\n \"Capitol Hill News\" said that Trump often made inconsistent comments on virus detection. He once said that the United States has more people tested than any other country, so the number of confirmed cases is also higher, in order to dilute the severity of the epidemic; but he also complained that the infection rate of new coronavirus in the United States is too high, and the number of confirmed cases is too high. Mostly because of the detection of too many people.\n Trump tweeted about virus detection on the 15th, which fully reflects his dual point of view: our virus detection is larger and more advanced than any other country (we have done a good job in this regard) !)

Detection is a double-edged sword-it makes us look bad, but it is a good thing!\n The report pointed out that US Vice President Pence also issued a similar comment on the 15th, suggesting that the White House has shifted its focus from responding to the new coronavirus epidemic to holding a presidential election rally and reopening the states as soon as possible. Pence said that despite the recent increase in the number of new cases in multiple states in the United States, the U.S. response to the epidemic has been steadily advancing.

Doctors can't recognize this disease, which is a mystery to them.\n As early as May 12, the U.S. Business Insider website once published an article stating that the United States may have the new coronavirus last December, but the US government only focused on China when it traced the epidemic in the early stages and made a fatal mistake.\n Because the New Crown Outbreak overlaps with the influenza season at the end of last year, more and more facts indicate that some deaths due to influenza are actually due to infection with the New Crown Virus. Previously, California has begun investigating the association between the deaths in December last year and the New Crown Outbreak.\n Coincidentally, according to the Buenos Aires Economic News Network of Argentina reported on June 5, according to the discovery of French scientists, the new coronavirus may have appeared in Europe in November 2019.\n Dr. Michelle Schmidt of the Albert Schweizer Hospital in Colmar, northeastern France and his research team examined thousands of chest X-rays taken at the end of 2019 and found images of two of them Consistent with the symptoms of new coronavirus.\n The report said that the two shootings took place on November 16th and 18th, and their appearance provided a new understanding for when the new coronavirus first attacked Europe, indicating that the virus officially reported the first case on January 24th. It has existed before.\n The epidemic data released by Johns Hopkins University in the United States show that as of June 6, Beijing time, around 6:30, the United States has diagnosed a total of 2130569 cases and a cumulative death of 116726 cases.\n And many experts have warned that the nationwide protests and demonstrations caused by the death of African-American man Freud are intensifying the spread of the virus.\n The Governor of Chang'an Street noticed that the domestic epidemic in the United States is still grim, the Trump administration has continued to dump the pot, and has repeatedly pointed the finger at China. But as more and more evidence is exposed, even close American allies have to admit that the United States is the culprit in its own epidemic.\n According to incomplete statistics, from mid-May to now, countries such as Australia, Israel, Canada and the United Kingdom have indicated that the United States is one of the main source countries of the virus.\n After covering for more than 4 months, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) reported on June 8 that the data released by the country’s British Columbia showed that the province’s new coronavirus strains were mainly from Canada and the United States and Europe.

    "content": "Just as the multi-state epidemic rebounded in the United States and the presidential election rally was about to restart, the White House New Crown Virus Working Group leader and Vice President Mike Pence published a signed article in the Wall Street Journal on the 16th, saying that the government has successfully contained the new crown The pneumonia epidemic, and criticized the media for deliberately disseminating panic messages that the epidemic rebounded.\n Pence wrote that some media sounded the ‘second wave’ alarm for the new coronary pneumonia epidemic, and this panic was exaggerated. The average number of people infected daily in the United States has increased from 30,000 in April to 20,000 currently. In the past 5 days, the number of daily deaths in the United States has dropped to less than 750.\n At the same time, Pence did not forget to brag about the government's ability to deal with the epidemic. Thanks to President Trump’s leadership and the courage and compassion of the American people, our public health system is much stronger than four months ago, and we are defeating invisible enemies.\n Pence believes that the media tried to frighten the American people and made a pessimistic prediction of the second wave of the epidemic. We have slowed the spread of the epidemic, we have taken care of the most vulnerable people, we have saved lives, and we have laid a solid foundation for any challenges we may face in the future. This is to be celebrated, not the fear spread by the media.\n In response, the US media have come up with data to refute. According to the 16th issue of \"Business Insider\" in the United States, the Vice President apparently did not mention that the number of newly diagnosed cases of new coronary pneumonia in more than 20 states in the United States has been on the rise. Many places have quickly lifted social distance measures and restarted business activities. Overall, the number of new coronary pneumonia cases in the United States has begun to stabilize, but it has not declined.\n The \"Washington Post\" reported that the number of New Coronary Pneumonia infections and hospitalizations in all US states are soaring. The two most populous states in the United States, Texas and Florida, reported the highest number of newly diagnosed cases reported last week. A recent survey by the Miami Herald found that the surge in new infections cannot be entirely attributed to the expansion of virus testing. Utah epidemiologists say the recurrence of infections is partly due to the restart of the economy in May.\n Anthony Fudge, the top expert in infectious diseases in the United States, warned that if the state and local governments do not strictly observe social distance measures, they will see the new crown virus make a comeback. The latest report from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shows that although the number of cases and deaths reported each day is declining, there are still signs that community-wide transmission is continuing throughout the United States. This is because some states have recently canceled outbound orders and restrictions on businesses.\n CNN quoted Ashsh Jaha, director of the Harvard Institute of Global Health, as saying on the 16th that we may have gotten rid of the'pandemic', but the pandemic has not completely ended. The reality is that the virus will still coexist with us. The first outbreak hit only a small part of the area, and now it is spreading to other places, perhaps a county, a city, or a state.\n US media said that many White House officials, including Pence, have been understating the public health crisis. Kudlow, director of the US National Economic Council and White House economic adviser, also said recently that the new coronavirus has been brought under control. In fact, the White House has largely shelved the issue of the new crown virus, and instead focused on other focal issues such as economic revitalization and police reform.\n The epidemic data released by Johns Hopkins University in the United States show that as of June 6, Beijing time, around 6:30, the United States has diagnosed a total of 2130569 cases and a cumulative death of 116726 cases. CNN on the 15th cited a US-focused prediction model that showed that by October 1 this year, the death toll of the new crown in the US is expected to exceed 200,000, and the number of single-day deaths in September and October is expected to rise significantly.
